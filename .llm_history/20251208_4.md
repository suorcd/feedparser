### Purpose
Resolve a compiler warning/error related to an unused import introduced during recent changes.

---

### Changes

- Updated: `src/parser_state.rs`
  - Removed unused wildcard import `use crate::*;` which was not needed and triggered an unused import warning.

---

### Build & Tests

- Build: `cargo build` — success (no warnings).
- Tests: `cargo test -- --nocapture` — success (4/4 tests passed).

---

### Notes

- No functional behavior changed; this is a cleanup to keep the code warning-free.
