      <title>The 9/11 Files: The Cover-up Commission | Ep 2</title>
      <description>The 9/11 Commission authorized by Congress was a total fraud from the beginning. Led by the same people who were responsible for preventing the attack, the Commission was deliberately “set up to fail.” 9/11 widow and lawyer Kristen Breitweiser forced the Bush administration’s hand, exposing how the Commission was designed to hide the truth.

      <title>Wikipedia Co-Creator Reveals All: CIA Infiltration, Banning Conservatives, &amp; How to Fix the Internet</title>
      <description>Larry Sanger built Wikipedia as an unbiased repository of the world’s knowledge, and then stood helplessly by as activists and intel agencies turned it into the most comprehensive propaganda op in human history. There’s nothing more corrupt.



(00:00) The Origins of Wikipedia

(04:27) Wikipedia’s Dangerous Policy Changes

(14:01) Who Is Responsible for Corrupting Wikipedia?

(27:39)  How Does Wikipedia Actually Work?

(37:28) Is Wikipedia Controlled by the Intel Agencies?

(43:16) Sanger’s Request to Elon Musk and Donald Trump to Help Fix Wikipedia

(1:01:41 ) How Wikipedia Can Be Saved

Larry Sanger is co-founder of Wikipedia. With a Ph.D. in Philosophy from Ohio State, Sanger's career moved from academia to educational and reference projects online. He is now president of the Knowledge Standards Foundation. He has been blogging at LarrySanger.org for twenty years, where he posts influential pieces about the internet, philosophy, education, and most recently theology (his conversion story went viral in February 2025). He also plays Irish fiddle and homeschools his boys.

      <title>The 9/11 Files: The CIA’s Secret Mission Gone Wrong | Ep 1</title>
      <description>A former FBI agent who was embedded in the CIA’s Bin Laden unit, Mark Rossini, claims the CIA was fully aware that the 9/11 hijackers were in the United States planning an attack. Rather than inform the FBI, the CIA tried to recruit two of the hijackers for a “false-flag” operation, which quickly spiraled out of control. The failed mission raises urgent questions about government secrecy, intelligence failures, and what really happened before 9/11.

We’ve centralized all the evidence, key players, and timeline into this Watch Companion: www.tuckercarlson.com/the-911-files-watch-companion-ep-1.

      <title>Dave Collum: Financial Crisis, Diddy, Energy Weapons, QAnon, and the Deep State’s Digital Evolution</title>
      <description>There aren’t many Ivy League professors as bold as Dave Collum. It’s amazing he still has a job.  



(00:00) How Collum Predicted the 2008 Financial Crisis

(11:00) Collum’s Mission to Uncover the Truth About Covid

(19:36) Government Experiments Being Conducted on Foster Care Children

(24:17) What’s the Truth About Diddy?

(34:07) What’s the Truth About the Assassination Attempt on Donald Trump?

(1:00:45) Are We Being Purposefully Distracted From Things That Actually Matter?

(1:12:04) The Real Dangers of AI



Dave Collum is a professor of organic chemistry at Cornell University, where he earned his BS in biology and later returned after completing his PhD in chemistry at Columbia. A former department chair and 20-year associate editor of The Journal of Organic Chemistry, Dave has also consulted for major pharmaceutical companies including Merck, Pfizer, and Amgen. Outside of academia, he’s known for his sharp, contrarian takes on politics, economics, and culture—often shared via his unfiltered X account (@DavidBCollum), frequent podcast appearances, and his widely read annual “Year in Review” at Peak Prosperity. He’s also coached collegiate gymnastics and taekwondo and has been featured in outlets like The Wall Street Journal, Rolling Stone, and The Federalist but usually on topics far removed from chemistry.

      <title>Sen. Eric Schmitt: FBI and DOJ Corruption, and How Politicized Judges Are Undermining America</title>
      <description>Sen. Eric Schmitt of Missouri was once an attorney general, so he understands that politicized judges are the real threat to American democracy.



(00:00) Is the Senate Broken?

(07:17) Why Congress Gave Away All Their Power to the Courts

(35:26) How Is Anthony Fauci Not in Jail?

(55:35) Why Do We Import All Our Pharmaceuticals From China?

(59:59) Why Aren’t the DOJ and FBI Doing Their Jobs?



US Senator Eric Schmitt is a 6th generation Missourian and previously served as Missouri Attorney General where he led consequential lawsuits against the Biden Administration. A first-term senator, Schmitt has emerged as a key ally for President Trump and Vice President Vance in Congress and is passionate about protecting Americans’ freedoms, combating mass migration, strengthening our national security, preventing US tax dollars from being wasted on never-ending wars overseas, and restoring American exceptionalism.

His new book “The Last Line of Defense: How to Beat the Left in Court” is out on August 19 and available for preorder now: https://a.co/d/1wgmq28

      <title>Hungary Prime Minister Viktor Orban on USAID, Trump, Immigration, NATO, and the Russia/Ukraine War</title>
      <description>Hungary’s Viktor Orban is by far the longest serving head of state in Europe, and by this point has been vindicated on pretty much everything. So when he says that going forward it’s Ukraine, not Russia, that may be the biggest threat to the west, it’s worth paying attention.

(00:00) Viktor Orban’s Predictions Were Right
(02:40) USAID’s Actions in Hungary
(04:29) Why Was USAID Spreading Transgenderism in Foreign Countries?
(09:18) George Soros’ Mission to Destroy the West
(11:16) Has This Mass Migration Policy Worked?
(15:52) Orban’s Assessment of the German Economy and Its Impact on the US
(23:26) Why Is the Destruction of Nord Stream Completely Ignored?

      <title>Tucker Carlson Reacts to Kamala Harris’s DNC Speech (with Special Guest Jason Whitlock)</title>
      <description>While Kamala Harris takes center stage at the DNC, Tucker Carlson and Jason Whitlock are providing unfiltered analysis in real-time.

You’d think she was a cultural icon. Our coverage is different.
