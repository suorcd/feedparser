			<description><![CDATA[<p>Self-leadership is the foundation of every form of leadership. In this episode, we explore why understanding our blind spots, recognising our biases, and practising honest self-reflection matter far more than experience or technical skill.Drawing on Daniel Goleman’s research on emotional intelligence, this conversation breaks down how self-awareness, self-regulation, and intentional growth directly influence the way we lead, communicate, and show up for others.If you’ve ever wondered what truly differentiates an “ultra leader,” or how to build the discipline of holding the mirror up to yourself, this episode offers a clear, practical pathway.</p><p><br /></p>
