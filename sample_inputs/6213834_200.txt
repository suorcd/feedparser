Through her coaching, she guides couples at different stages of the relationship via three core pathways — Rekindling Us (rediscovering passion at midlife), Rebuilding Us (transforming crisis into connection), and Creating Us (laying a strong foundation for lasting love and sexual intimacy for new couples) — always anchored in the principle of consciously and intentionally choosing “us.”</p><p><b>Connect with Irene</b></p><p>You can connect with Irene on LinkedIn at <a href='https://www.linkedin.com/in/irenefehr'>Irene Fehr</a> and on Facebook at <a href='http://www.facebook.com/ignitedwoman'>Ignited Woman</a>.  You can follow Irene on Instagram at <a href='http://www.instagram.com/ignitedwoman'>Ignited Woman</a> and on her YouTube channel at <a href='http://www.youtube.com/ignitedwoman'>Ignited Woman</a>.  To find out how to work with Irene visit her website at <a href='http://www.irenefehr.com/'>Ignited Woman</a>.</p><p><b>Links to articles mentioned in podcast</b></p><p><a href='https://l.mailtrack.com/l/26d19ea25000a2679f26c549aacfd8c32f61a50f?u=5420610'>Why Your Partner Won’t Get Couples Counseling and How to Get Them On Board</a> </p><p><a href='https://l.mailtrack.com/l/f7c6224b46c9f97a0c39d541f4d727d34e5ae0dd?u=5420610'>3 Warning Signs of Divorce and How to Address Them Before It&apos;s Too Late</a> </p><p><br/><b>Karen Covy</b> is a Divorce Coach and Consultant, Lawyer, Author, and Speaker who is dedicated to helping people make the best decisions possible for themselves, their families, and their future - especially in stressful times.

Determined to dispel myths about why sex dies in a long-term relationship, her views have been featured globally in HuffPost, Cosmopolitan, Shape, Refinery29, ScaryMommy, EliteDaily, and Bustle. Through her coaching, she guides couples at different stages of the relationship via three core pathways — Rekindling Us (rediscovering passion at midlife), Rebuilding Us (transforming crisis into connection), and Creating Us (laying a strong foundation for lasting love and sexual intimacy for new couples) — always anchored in the principle of consciously and intentionally choosing “us.”</p><p><b>Connect with Irene</b></p><p>You can connect with Irene on LinkedIn at <a href='https://www.linkedin.com/in/irenefehr'>Irene Fehr</a> and on Facebook at <a href='http://www.facebook.com/ignitedwoman'>Ignited Woman</a>.  You can follow Irene on Instagram at <a href='http://www.instagram.com/ignitedwoman'>Ignited Woman</a> and on her YouTube channel at <a href='http://www.youtube.com/ignitedwoman'>Ignited Woman</a>.  To find out how to work with Irene visit her website at <a href='http://www.irenefehr.com/'>Ignited Woman</a>.</p><p><b>Links to articles mentioned in podcast</b></p><p><a href='https://l.mailtrack.com/l/26d19ea25000a2679f26c549aacfd8c32f61a50f?u=5420610'>Why Your Partner Won’t Get Couples Counseling and How to Get Them On Board</a> </p><p><a href='https://l.mailtrack.com/l/f7c6224b46c9f97a0c39d541f4d727d34e5ae0dd?u=5420610'>3 Warning Signs of Divorce and How to Address Them Before It&apos;s Too Late</a> </p><p><br/><b>Karen Covy</b> is a Divorce Coach and Consultant, Lawyer, Author, and Speaker who is dedicated to helping people make the best decisions possible for themselves, their families, and their future - especially in stressful times.

    <description><![CDATA[<p><b>WARNING: This episode might be triggering for anyone who has experienced or is trying to heal from domestic violence, sexual abuse, financial abuse or any type of intimate partner abuse. Listener discretion is advised.</b></p><p>What if the love you&apos;ve been desperately seeking could actually kill you? Dana Diaz knows this reality firsthand. She spent nearly three decades in a marriage where the emotional abuse was so severe that her body began to shut down. What’s worse is that the seeds of her suffering were planted long before adulthood.</p><p>Raised by a distant, neglectful mother and an abusive stepfather, Dana grew up believing that love and pain were inseparable. That early conditioning left her vulnerable to repeating the same cycle in marriage, a cycle that would take her decades to escape.</p><p>When her marriage became abusive, she found herself accepting treatment she knew was wrong, because it was the only version of &quot;love&quot; she&apos;d ever known. The consequences were devastating. Her body produced such astronomically high levels of stress hormones that her immune system turned against her, leaving her skeletal, oxygen-dependent, and facing organ failure in her early 40s.</p><p>Through careful planning, hidden savings, and ultimately having the courage to choose herself, Dana escaped a situation that escalated to threats, gunshots, and a legal system that initially failed to protect her. </p><p>Today, Dana is healthy, remarried, and dedicated to helping others recognize the signs of narcissistic abuse and reclaiming their lives. Her book <em>Gasping for Air: The Stranglehold of Narcissistic Abuse</em> chronicles her journey from victim to survivor to advocate, offering hope to anyone wondering if they deserve better.</p><p>This episode, which was originally published in October, 2023, is being replayed here to support Domestic Violence Awareness Month.</p><p><b>NOTE:</b> If you or someone you know is experiencing intimate partner abuse, please contact the domestic violence hotline as soon as possible.</p><p><b>National Domestic Violence Hotline 800-799-7233</b></p><p><b>About Dana</b></p><p>Dana studied journalism and psychology at DePaul University. She has also had life-long experiences with narcissistic abuse. Thankfully her education gave her the ability to accurately express how narcissistic abuse creates confusion and conflict within victims. </p><p>Today, Dana is a proud voice for fellow victims who are unable, afraid, or too ashamed to share their experiences. She strives to create awareness and understanding to ensure victims are given the support they need to both understand their situation and heal from it.</p><p><b>Connect with Dana</b></p><p>You can learn more about Dana and her story on her website <a href='https://danasdiaz.com/'>Dana S Diaz.</a>   Dana also has a quiz to help you determine if you are in a relationship involving narcissistic abuse.<br/><br/>You can follow Dana on Facebook at <a href='https://www.facebook.com/DanaSDiazAuthor/'>Dana S Diaz</a> and Instagram at <a href='https://www.instagram.com/danas.diaz/'>Dana S Diaz</a>.  You can get your copy of Dana&apos;s best-selling book, &quot;<a href='https://amzn.to/3PXFC2O'><em>Gasping for Air:  The Stranglehold of Narcissistic Abuse</em></a><em></em></p><p><br/><b>Karen Covy</b> is a Divorce Coach and Consultant, Lawyer, Author, and Speaker who is dedicated to helping people make the best decisions possible for themselves, their families, and their future - especially in stressful times.

What’s worse is that the seeds of her suffering were planted long before adulthood.</p><p>Raised by a distant, neglectful mother and an abusive stepfather, Dana grew up believing that love and pain were inseparable. That early conditioning left her vulnerable to repeating the same cycle in marriage, a cycle that would take her decades to escape.</p><p>When her marriage became abusive, she found herself accepting treatment she knew was wrong, because it was the only version of &quot;love&quot; she&apos;d ever known. The consequences were devastating. Her body produced such astronomically high levels of stress hormones that her immune system turned against her, leaving her skeletal, oxygen-dependent, and facing organ failure in her early 40s.</p><p>Through careful planning, hidden savings, and ultimately having the courage to choose herself, Dana escaped a situation that escalated to threats, gunshots, and a legal system that initially failed to protect her. </p><p>Today, Dana is healthy, remarried, and dedicated to helping others recognize the signs of narcissistic abuse and reclaiming their lives. Her book <em>Gasping for Air: The Stranglehold of Narcissistic Abuse</em> chronicles her journey from victim to survivor to advocate, offering hope to anyone wondering if they deserve better.</p><p>This episode, which was originally published in October, 2023, is being replayed here to support Domestic Violence Awareness Month.</p><p><b>NOTE:</b> If you or someone you know is experiencing intimate partner abuse, please contact the domestic violence hotline as soon as possible.</p><p><b>National Domestic Violence Hotline 800-799-7233</b></p><p><b>About Dana</b></p><p>Dana studied journalism and psychology at DePaul University. She has also had life-long experiences with narcissistic abuse. Thankfully her education gave her the ability to accurately express how narcissistic abuse creates confusion and conflict within victims. </p><p>Today, Dana is a proud voice for fellow victims who are unable, afraid, or too ashamed to share their experiences. She strives to create awareness and understanding to ensure victims are given the support they need to both understand their situation and heal from it.</p><p><b>Connect with Dana</b></p><p>You can learn more about Dana and her story on her website <a href='https://danasdiaz.com/'>Dana S Diaz.</a>   Dana also has a quiz to help you determine if you are in a relationship involving narcissistic abuse.<br/><br/>You can follow Dana on Facebook at <a href='https://www.facebook.com/DanaSDiazAuthor/'>Dana S Diaz</a> and Instagram at <a href='https://www.instagram.com/danas.diaz/'>Dana S Diaz</a>.  You can get your copy of Dana&apos;s best-selling book, &quot;<a href='https://amzn.to/3PXFC2O'><em>Gasping for Air:  The Stranglehold of Narcissistic Abuse</em></a><em></em></p><p><br/><b>Karen Covy</b> is a Divorce Coach and Consultant, Lawyer, Author, and Speaker who is dedicated to helping people make the best decisions possible for themselves, their families, and their future - especially in stressful times.

    <description><![CDATA[<p><b>Episode Description - Breaking Toxic Relationship Patterns in Love</b></p><p>The mysterious patterns that keep showing up in your relationships aren&apos;t coincidences – they&apos;re clues to your family inheritance. Johanna Lynn, founder of the Family Imprint Institute, joins us to reveal how our relationship patterns are blueprinted by two generations of family history through the science of epigenetics.<br/><br/>Ever wonder why criticism feels so devastating? Or why you&apos;re drawn to partners who trigger the same old wounds? Joanna explains how these patterns are coded into our emotional DNA. Through her work creating multi-generational genograms, she helps clients visually map these connections, often leading to profound &quot;aha&quot; moments about why they struggle with certain persistent (and often toxic) relationship patterns.<br/><br/>Johanna also shares her unique perspective on forgiveness. Contrary to conventional wisdom, she suggests that <em>understanding</em> is more powerful than <em>forgiveness</em> for healing relationship wounds. &quot;Forgiveness misses the point,&quot; she explains, offering a radical alternative for restoring balance after betrayal that doesn&apos;t involve staying trapped in guilt or resentment.<br/><br/>Drawing from her own divorce experience, Johanna shares practical strategies for breaking inherited patterns. ​</p><p>Whether you&apos;re navigating a difficult relationship, healing after divorce, or simply curious about why you keep encountering the same relationship challenges, this conversation offers both immediate insights and long-term hope.</p><p><b>About Johanna</b></p><p>Johanna Lynn is the founder of The Family Imprint Institute, dedicated to helping smart, self-aware people stop repeating the same exhausting relationship patterns—especially after divorce.

    <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><b>Episode Description - Breaking Toxic Relationship Patterns in Love</b></p><p>The mysterious patterns that keep showing up in your relationships aren&apos;t coincidences – they&apos;re clues to your family inheritance. Johanna Lynn, founder of the Family Imprint Institute, joins us to reveal how our relationship patterns are blueprinted by two generations of family history through the science of epigenetics.<br/><br/>Ever wonder why criticism feels so devastating? Or why you&apos;re drawn to partners who trigger the same old wounds? Joanna explains how these patterns are coded into our emotional DNA. Through her work creating multi-generational genograms, she helps clients visually map these connections, often leading to profound &quot;aha&quot; moments about why they struggle with certain persistent (and often toxic) relationship patterns.<br/><br/>Johanna also shares her unique perspective on forgiveness. Contrary to conventional wisdom, she suggests that <em>understanding</em> is more powerful than <em>forgiveness</em> for healing relationship wounds. &quot;Forgiveness misses the point,&quot; she explains, offering a radical alternative for restoring balance after betrayal that doesn&apos;t involve staying trapped in guilt or resentment.<br/><br/>Drawing from her own divorce experience, Johanna shares practical strategies for breaking inherited patterns. ​</p><p>Whether you&apos;re navigating a difficult relationship, healing after divorce, or simply curious about why you keep encountering the same relationship challenges, this conversation offers both immediate insights and long-term hope.</p><p><b>About Johanna</b></p><p>Johanna Lynn is the founder of The Family Imprint Institute, dedicated to helping smart, self-aware people stop repeating the same exhausting relationship patterns—especially after divorce.

    <description><![CDATA[<p>Trying to keep the house in a divorce? You might be missing the one expert who can actually make that happen. </p><p>In this episode, Jeffrey Landers—real estate veteran, mortgage broker, and Certified Divorce Financial Analyst—breaks down the critical role a divorce lending professional can play in a divorce. </p><p>With over a decade of experience, Jeff helps divorcing people navigate the financial chaos of divorce so they can afford to keep their house. In this episode, he walks us through the pitfalls that trip people up—like relying on voluntary child support, misunderstanding joint debt, or assuming a judge-approved settlement means you’ll qualify for a mortgage. </p><p>Jeff explains how lender rules work in the real world, and why things like debt-to-income ratios, timelines, and the fine print of your divorce settlement agreement can make or break your refinance. He also dives into smart, proactive strategies—like structuring settlements to improve loan eligibility, starting temporary support early, and even getting a home inspection before finalizing anything.</p><p>The conversation is packed with practical tips, cautionary tales, and eye-opening insights that most divorce lawyers don’t know to tell you. </p><p>Whether you’re sure you want to keep the house in your divorce or you’re still trying to decide if that’s possible, bringing a divorce lending professional onto your divorce team is key.</p><p>If your future (and your kids’ stability) depends on staying in your home, this is one conversation you can’t afford to miss.</p><p><b>About Jeffrey</b></p><p>Jeff Landers is a seasoned real estate/mortgage and divorce expert with over 40 years of combined experience. In 2010, Jeff founded Bedrock Divorce Advisors, LLC, working exclusively with women going through a financially complicated divorce.</p><p>Dealing with the marital home is almost always a major issue in any divorce.

    <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Trying to keep the house in a divorce? You might be missing the one expert who can actually make that happen. </p><p>In this episode, Jeffrey Landers—real estate veteran, mortgage broker, and Certified Divorce Financial Analyst—breaks down the critical role a divorce lending professional can play in a divorce. </p><p>With over a decade of experience, Jeff helps divorcing people navigate the financial chaos of divorce so they can afford to keep their house. In this episode, he walks us through the pitfalls that trip people up—like relying on voluntary child support, misunderstanding joint debt, or assuming a judge-approved settlement means you’ll qualify for a mortgage. </p><p>Jeff explains how lender rules work in the real world, and why things like debt-to-income ratios, timelines, and the fine print of your divorce settlement agreement can make or break your refinance. He also dives into smart, proactive strategies—like structuring settlements to improve loan eligibility, starting temporary support early, and even getting a home inspection before finalizing anything.</p><p>The conversation is packed with practical tips, cautionary tales, and eye-opening insights that most divorce lawyers don’t know to tell you. </p><p>Whether you’re sure you want to keep the house in your divorce or you’re still trying to decide if that’s possible, bringing a divorce lending professional onto your divorce team is key.</p><p>If your future (and your kids’ stability) depends on staying in your home, this is one conversation you can’t afford to miss.</p><p><b>About Jeffrey</b></p><p>Jeff Landers is a seasoned real estate/mortgage and divorce expert with over 40 years of combined experience. In 2010, Jeff founded Bedrock Divorce Advisors, LLC, working exclusively with women going through a financially complicated divorce.</p><p>Dealing with the marital home is almost always a major issue in any divorce.

    <description><![CDATA[<p>When your marriage crumbles, figuring out how to effectively parent with your ex can feel like navigating a minefield. Co-parenting counseling, an approach that helps divorced couples prioritize their children&apos;s needs over their own complicated emotions, can help. </p><p>In this podcast episode licensed professional counselor Kelley Hopkins-Alvarez explains how.</p><p>Co-parenting counselors are licensed mental health professionals who provide expert recommendations and guidance to help parents communicate better and make child-focused decisions.  </p><p>Unlike court-appointed parenting coordinators, co-parenting counselors don’t have the authority to adjudicate disputes or enforce parenting agreements.

Co-parenting counseling can help you transform your contentious parental dynamics into a productive partnership, helping you and your spouse align on critical parenting decisions.</p><p>If you or someone you know is experiencing parenting challenges, this podcast episode just might change everything for you.<br/><br/><b>About Kelley<br/></b>Kelley Hopkins-Alvarez, LPC, is a Licensed Professional Counselor in private practice in Ridgefield, Connecticut, specializing in assisting couples at relationship crossroads, particularly when one party is uncertain about the marriage&apos;s future.

Kelley also provides non-adversarial divorce support to divorcing partners, helping them navigate communication impasses to make important decisions during and after the divorce process.

    <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>When your marriage crumbles, figuring out how to effectively parent with your ex can feel like navigating a minefield. Co-parenting counseling, an approach that helps divorced couples prioritize their children&apos;s needs over their own complicated emotions, can help. </p><p>In this podcast episode licensed professional counselor Kelley Hopkins-Alvarez explains how.</p><p>Co-parenting counselors are licensed mental health professionals who provide expert recommendations and guidance to help parents communicate better and make child-focused decisions.  </p><p>Unlike court-appointed parenting coordinators, co-parenting counselors don’t have the authority to adjudicate disputes or enforce parenting agreements. They do, however, have the skills and ability to help parents create a functional new family dynamic where both parents can learn to work together for their children&apos;s wellbeing.</p><p>If you’re searching for practical strategies for navigating common co-parenting dilemmas, such as setting boundaries, managing emotions, and creating actionable goals that prioritize children’s well-being, this episode may provide the answers you seek. Co-parenting counseling can help you transform your contentious parental dynamics into a productive partnership, helping you and your spouse align on critical parenting decisions.</p><p>If you or someone you know is experiencing parenting challenges, this podcast episode just might change everything for you.<br/><br/><b>About Kelley<br/></b>Kelley Hopkins-Alvarez, LPC, is a Licensed Professional Counselor in private practice in Ridgefield, Connecticut, specializing in assisting couples at relationship crossroads, particularly when one party is uncertain about the marriage&apos;s future. She offers Couples Therapy, Affair Recovery, Sex Therapy, Discernment Counseling, Healing Separation Support, and Co-Parenting Counseling. Kelley also provides non-adversarial divorce support to divorcing partners, helping them navigate communication impasses to make important decisions during and after the divorce process.

    <description><![CDATA[<p>The two things everyone will face one day are death and taxes. Estate planning attorney Lindsey Paige Markus helps her clients plan for what will happen at their death and protect as much of their wealth from unnecessary taxes as possible.  As a trusted advisor and bestselling author, Lindsey demystifies the world of trusts, asset protection, and tax planning, revealing how proper estate planning can safeguard your legacy and provide for your loved ones.</p><p>In this episode, Lindsey explains how estate planning goes far beyond just having a will. She discusses the power of trusts to protect assets from creditors and ex-spouses, as well as their ability to minimize tax liabilities. With major changes to estate tax laws on the horizon, Lindsey stresses the urgency for high-net-worth individuals to act now. She explores how certain kinds of trusts can be used strategically to protect wealth, even in complex situations like divorce. </p><p>Lindsey also explains how proper estate planning can help couples who don’t want to divorce, but also don’t want to continue living in a traditional marriage, restructure their marriage in a way that preserves their wealth for their children. In this type of “legacy marriage” couples can continue to achieve their financial goals AND create a different kind of relationship that allows them to stay “married” but live life on their terms.<br/><br/><b>About Lindsey<br/></b>Lindsey heads Chuhak &amp; Tecson’s 25-attorney Estate Planning &amp; Asset Protection group and works closely with business owners and families to plan their estates, protect assets, transfer wealth and reduce tax liabilities.

But when she found herself in a doctor&apos;s office because she only weighed 90 pounds and her organs were shutting down, Dana knew something had to change.<br/><br/></p><p>In this podcast episode, we dive deeply into the world of fear, violence, and abuse. With unflinching honesty, Dana shares her journey through an abusive childhood, an abusive marriage, and the life of resilience and recovery she’s finally created since her divorce.<br/><br/></p><p>Dana chronicles how she finally broke free from the violence and abuse. (Spoiler alert: Just getting a divorce didn’t change that!) Her story of courage reminds us all about the power resilience and self-love have to change lives.<br/><br/></p><p><b>WARNING: This episode might be triggering for anyone who has experienced or is trying to heal from domestic violence, sexual abuse, financial abuse, or any type of intimate partner abuse.

She strives to create awareness and understanding to ensure victims are given the support they need to both understand their situation and heal from it.<br/><br/></p><p>Dana’s first book<em>, Gasping For Air: The Stranglehold Of Narcissistic Abuse.</em> chronicles her experiences in a 25-year-long abusive marriage, as well as the healing and empowerment she’s experienced since then.<br/><br/></p><p><b>Where to Connect with Dana<br/></b>You can learn more about Dana and her story on her website <a href='https://danasdiaz.com/'>Dana S Diaz.</a>   Dana also has a quiz to help you determine if you are in a relationship involving narcissistic abuse. <br/> <br/>You can follow Dana on Facebook at <a href='https://www.facebook.com/DanaSDiazAuthor/'>Dana S Diaz</a> and on Instagram at <a href='https://www.instagram.com/danas.diaz/'>Dana S Diaz</a>.  You can get your copy of Dana&apos;s best-selling book, &quot;<a href='https://amzn.to/3PXFC2O'><em>Gasping for Air:  The Stranglehold of Narcissistic Abuse</em></a><em>&quot;</em>  on her <a href='https://danasdiaz.com/books/'>website</a> or wherever books are sold.<br/><br/></p><p><br/><b>Karen Covy</b> is a Divorce Coach and Consultant, Lawyer, Author, and Speaker who is dedicated to helping people make the best decisions possible for themselves, their families, and their future - especially in stressful times.

As a child of divorced parents, a former college professor, and a litigant in her own divorce, Jennifer has a unique understanding of, and approach to, the divorce process that provides a comprehensive education for her clients regarding how their family law matters stand to impact themselves and their children. </p><p> </p><p><b>Where to Connect with Jennifer<br/></b>You can find Dr. Lavin on Facebook at <a href='https://www.facebook.com/jenniferllavinpc/'>Jennifer L.

    <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><b>Episode Description</b></p><p>High-conflict parents often fight over their kids throughout their divorce, and for years afterward.  They become &quot;frequent flyers&quot; in the court system, embroiling their kids in ongoing legal battles that drain both parents&apos; resources and cause enormous anxiety for their children. </p><p>Parenting coordinators are specially-trained divorce professionals who work with parents to resolve their conflicts quickly, efficiently, and OUTSIDE of the court system.  Yet, because parenting coordination is so new in the world of family law, people often misunderstand what parenting coordination is, and who it can help.</p><p>In this episode, Dr. Jennifer Lavin, and Dr. Gail Petrich both discuss their roles as parenting coordinators and how they work with high-conflict parents to decide their parenting issues and keep them out of court.</p><p><br/><b>Show Notes</b></p><p><b>About Jennifer<br/></b>Dr. Jennifer Lavin is the principal attorney of <a href='https://lavinfamilylaw.com/'>Jennifer L. Lavin, P.C.</a> Jennifer focuses her practice exclusively on divorce and family law matters. Jennifer is a divorce and family law mediator in Cook County, and a fellow with the Collaborative Law Institute of Illinois. She&apos;s also a court-appointed child representative guardian ad litem and parenting coordinator in Cook County. As a child of divorced parents, a former college professor, and a litigant in her own divorce, Jennifer has a unique understanding of, and approach to, the divorce process that provides a comprehensive education for her clients regarding how their family law matters stand to impact themselves and their children. </p><p> </p><p><b>Where to Connect with Jennifer<br/></b>You can find Dr. Lavin on Facebook at <a href='https://www.facebook.com/jenniferllavinpc/'>Jennifer L.
