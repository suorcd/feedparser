    <itunes:summary><![CDATA[Standing up for what you believe is right can come at a cost—just take a look at the headlines from the past few weeks. In this week’s episode, you’ll meet a remarkable woman who did exactly that. She took a stand for her convictions and paid a steep price—she nearly died. But she didn’t back down. She kept going, kept fighting. In the end, she came out a winner—not because she crossed the finish line first, but because the journey brought her closer to her Creator.
