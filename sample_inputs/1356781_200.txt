Elaine Mokhtefi is author of "Algiers, Third World Capital: Freedom fighters, Revolutionaries, Black Panthers." This fascinating discussion retraces Elaine's early political engagement with the FLN mission to the UN, her decision to move to Algeria to help build the postcolonial nation after liberation from France, her experiences as a translator and journalist covering the transnational movements for liberation across the Global South, and work with the Black Panthers exiled in Algiers. She danced with Fanon, met radical third world leaders, and struggled for a better world. Now in her 90's, she remains an inspiring and committed activist.

      <description><![CDATA[<p>This week, we bring you an episode from our sister program The Adnan Husain Show.  Enjoy!</p> <hr /> <p class="MsoNormal">In this first part of a two part series, Adnan has an epic conversation with Dr. Isa Blumi, historian and Professor of Turkish and Middle Eastern Studies at Stockholm University, about Yemen's modern history of resisting colonialism geopolitically and global capitalism. Author of <em>Destroying Yemen: What Chaos in Arabia Tells Us about the World</em>, Dr. Blumi masterfully analyzes and integrates the geographic, social, economic, cultural, political and religious dimensions of Yemen's distinctive historical experience. If you want to understand why Ansarullah as a popular movement has taken leadership of active solidarity with the people of Gaza in confronting ZioAmerican empire, this episode will be indispensable.</p> <p class="MsoNormal">To consult more of Dr. Isa Blumi's recent work on Yemen and the Gulf region:</p> <p class="MsoNormal">Blumi, Isa. <em>Destroying Yemen: What chaos in Arabia tells us about the world</em>.

      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>This week, we bring you an episode from our sister program The Adnan Husain Show. Enjoy!</p> <p class="MsoNormal">In this first part of a two part series, Adnan has an epic conversation with Dr. Isa Blumi, historian and Professor of Turkish and Middle Eastern Studies at Stockholm University, about Yemen's modern history of resisting colonialism geopolitically and global capitalism. Author of <em>Destroying Yemen: What Chaos in Arabia Tells Us about the World</em>, Dr. Blumi masterfully analyzes and integrates the geographic, social, economic, cultural, political and religious dimensions of Yemen's distinctive historical experience. If you want to understand why Ansarullah as a popular movement has taken leadership of active solidarity with the people of Gaza in confronting ZioAmerican empire, this episode will be indispensable.</p> <p class="MsoNormal">To consult more of Dr. Isa Blumi's recent work on Yemen and the Gulf region:</p> <p class="MsoNormal">Blumi, Isa. <em>Destroying Yemen: What chaos in Arabia tells us about the world</em>.

      <description><![CDATA[<p>In this episode of Guerrilla History, we bring on two wonderful comrades to take on a pretty big topic of traitors and sellouts, the processes that take place that cause ideological changing, and some case studies of this phenomenon, including the discussion of <a href= "https://link.springer.com/referenceworkentry/10.1007/978-3-031-25399-7_82-2"> Zak Cope's recent heel turn from Thirdworldist to radical free market capitalist and Zionist</a>, and how to try to prevent this from happening within our organizations and within ourselves.  We could not ask for better guests to tackle this topic than returning friend Manny Ness, who had collaborated with Cope in the past, and J.

      <description><![CDATA[<p>In this episode of Guerrilla History, we are lucky to be joined by a special guest in Cuba as well as a special guest host whom many of you will likely remember from past episodes of the show.  Here, we bring on Cuban journalist <a href= "https://www.bellyofthebeastcuba.com/team">Liz Oliva Fernández from Belly of the Beast</a> to discuss Bob Menendez (who was just convicted on corruption charges), US-Cuba policy, and how these are related. This episode is being based off of two documentaries that Liz hosted for Belly of the Beast - <a href= "https://youtu.be/PfRTNTWkPgY?si=1JA3Q3m8BLJ_6Luc">Hardliner of the Hudson</a> which takes a deep look at Menendez, and <a href= "https://youtu.be/XaKB3pSLmGU?si=MuIkpX5lMWaBYjjE">Uphill on the Hill</a> which is an examination of recent US-Cuba policy. Watch these, and subscribe to <a href= "https://www.youtube.com/@BellyofTheBeastCuba">Belly of the Beast on YouTube</a>!</p> <p>Adnan was not able to join Henry for this one, so we drafted in our friend and former guest <strong><a href= "twitter.com/trgenovese">Taylor Genovese</a></strong> as a special guest host.  Taylor is an Assistant Professor of Philosophy at Dutchess Community College, an editor at <a href= "iskrabooks.org">Iskra Books</a>, and a documentary filmmaker.  You may remember Taylor as a guest from two previous episodes - <a href= "https://guerrillahistory.libsyn.com/peasants-revolt-of-1381-w-taylor-genovese"> Peasants' Revolt of 1381</a> and <a href= "https://guerrillahistory.libsyn.com/art-and-the-working-class-w-taylor-genovese"> Art and the Working Class</a>.  Major thanks to Taylor for coming in on relatively short notice for this one!</p> <p><strong>Liz Oliva Fernández</strong> is a Cuban journalist and the presenter of The War on Cuba, for which she won a Gracie Award.

      <description><![CDATA[<p>In this episode of Guerrilla History, we once again have our great friend and comrade Zhun Xu, whom you should remember from two previous episodes of the show, <a href= "https://guerrillahistory.libsyn.com/north-korea-industrial-agriculture-w-zhun-xu"> North Korea & Industrial Agriculture</a> as well as  <a href= "https://guerrillahistory.libsyn.com/sanctions-against-china-their-political-economy-w-zhun-xu"> Sanctions Against China & Their Political Economy</a>.  Here, we discuss Zhun fantastic book <a href= "https://monthlyreview.org/product/from-commune-to-capitalism-how-chinas-peasants-lost-collective-farming-and-gained-urban-poverty/"> <em>From Commune to Capitalism: How China's Peasants Lost Collective Farming and Gained Urban Poverty</em></a>!  Unsurprisingly, this was a fabulous discussion, and is a really important conversation when added to the two conversations on this period of history that we had in our Modern Chinese History miniseries with Ken Hammond - <a href= "https://guerrillahistory.libsyn.com/the-great-leap-forward-cultural-revolution-w-ken-hammond-modern-chinese-history-pt-3"> The Great Leap Forward & Cultural Revolution</a> and the <a href= "https://guerrillahistory.libsyn.com/the-deng-reform-period-w-ken-hammond-modern-chinese-history-pt-4">Deng Reform Period</a>. It might be helpful to listen to those two episodes first, but regardless, we are sure that you will find great use in this conversation!</p> <p><strong>Zhun Xu</strong> is Associate Professor of Economics at John Jay College, City University of New York. He is on the editorial boards of Science and Society and the Journal of Labor and Society. His recent book is <a href= "https://monthlyreview.org/product/from-commune-to-capitalism-how-chinas-peasants-lost-collective-farming-and-gained-urban-poverty/"> <em>From Commune to Capitalism: How China's Peasants Lost Collective Farming and Gained Urban Poverty</em></a>.</p> <p><span style= "font-family: -apple-system, BlinkMacSystemFont, 'Segoe UI', Roboto, Oxygen, Ubuntu, Cantarell, 'Open Sans', 'Helvetica Neue', sans-serif;"> Help support the show by signing up to our patreon, where you also will get bonus content:</span> <a style= "font-family: -apple-system, BlinkMacSystemFont, 'Segoe UI', Roboto, Oxygen, Ubuntu, Cantarell, 'Open Sans', 'Helvetica Neue', sans-serif;" href= "https://www.patreon.com/guerrillahistory">https://www.patreon.com/guerrillahistory</a><span style="font-family: -apple-system, BlinkMacSystemFont, 'Segoe UI', Roboto, Oxygen, Ubuntu, Cantarell, 'Open Sans', 'Helvetica Neue', sans-serif;"> </span></p>]]></description>

Unsurprisingly, this was a fabulous discussion, and is a really important conversation when added to the two conversations on this period of history that we had in our Modern Chinese History miniseries with Ken Hammond - <a href= "https://guerrillahistory.libsyn.com/the-great-leap-forward-cultural-revolution-w-ken-hammond-modern-chinese-history-pt-3"> The Great Leap Forward & Cultural Revolution</a> and the <a href= "https://guerrillahistory.libsyn.com/the-deng-reform-period-w-ken-hammond-modern-chinese-history-pt-4">Deng Reform Period</a>. It might be helpful to listen to those two episodes first, but regardless, we are sure that you will find great use in this conversation!</p> <p>Zhun Xu is Associate Professor of Economics at John Jay College, City University of New York. He is on the editorial boards of Science and Society and the Journal of Labor and Society. His recent book is <a href= "https://monthlyreview.org/product/from-commune-to-capitalism-how-chinas-peasants-lost-collective-farming-and-gained-urban-poverty/"> <em>From Commune to Capitalism: How China's Peasants Lost Collective Farming and Gained Urban Poverty</em></a>.</p> <p> Help support the show by signing up to our patreon, where you also will get bonus content: <a style= "font-family: -apple-system, BlinkMacSystemFont, 'Segoe UI', Roboto, Oxygen, Ubuntu, Cantarell, 'Open Sans', 'Helvetica Neue', sans-serif;" href= "https://www.patreon.com/guerrillahistory">https://www.patreon.com/guerrillahistory</a> </p>]]></content:encoded>

Here, Adnan and Dr. Ardi Imseis, explore the complexities of international law, human rights and the urgent imperative of addressing the current situation of Palestine. Through meticulous research and unwavering dedication to justice, Imseis's scholarship offers invaluable insights into the legal frameworks that underpin the Palestinian struggle.

The final installment will drop in two weeks (with another episode in between), and will cover the Reform period, so be sure to subscribe to not miss that episode!</p> <p>Ken Hammond is Professor of East Asian and Global History at New Mexico State University. He has been engaged in radical politics since his involvement in the anti-war movement at Kent State in 1968-70. Ken is also the author of the book <a href= "https://1804books.com/products/chinas-revolution-and-the-quest-for-a-socialist-future"> China's Revolution & the Quest for a Socialist Future</a>.</p> <p> Help support the show by signing up to our patreon, where you also will get bonus content: <a style= "font-family: -apple-system, BlinkMacSystemFont, 'Segoe UI', Roboto, Oxygen, Ubuntu, Cantarell, 'Open Sans', 'Helvetica Neue', sans-serif;" href= "https://www.patreon.com/guerrillahistory">https://www.patreon.com/guerrillahistory</a> </p>]]></content:encoded>

      <description><![CDATA[<p>In this outstanding episode of Guerrilla History, we bring on Jon Melrod to discuss his new book <a href= "https://pmpress.org/index.php?l=product_detail&p=1289">Fighting Times: Organizing on the Front Lines of the Class War</a> (use code FIGHTING to get 40% off)!  In this episode, we discuss the life and times of Jon, who in many ways is a real working class hero.  We talk about his early embrace of radical political ideology, his radical campus organizing, his 13 years fighting in and organizing within industrial factories in Wisconsin, his rise within the UAW, and his post-factory work as a lawyer representing political refugees and victims of police violence.  This conversation is really inspiring, and we cannot recommend enough that you pick up the book, read it with fellow workers, and share this episode with those you think would benefit!</p> <p><strong>Jon Melrod</strong> is a journalist, activist, and lawyer that left the campus for the factory in 1973. For thirteen years, he immersed himself in the day-to-day struggles of Milwaukee's working class, both on the factory floor and in the political arena. Despite FBI surveillance and interference, Jon organized a militant rank-and-file caucus and rose through union ranks to a top leadership position in UAW Local 72. After this part of his career, he opened a law firm in San Francisco, successfully representing hundreds of political refugees.  You can follow Jon on twitter <a href= "twitter.com/JonathanMelrod">@JonathanMelrod</a>, and keep up with his latest work and read more about his story on his website <a href="jonathanmelrod.com">jonathanmelrod.com</a>.</p> <p><span style= "font-family: -apple-system, BlinkMacSystemFont, 'Segoe UI', Roboto, Oxygen, Ubuntu, Cantarell, 'Open Sans', 'Helvetica Neue', sans-serif;"> Help support the show by signing up to our patreon, where you also will get bonus content:</span> <a style= "font-family: -apple-system, BlinkMacSystemFont, 'Segoe UI', Roboto, Oxygen, Ubuntu, Cantarell, 'Open Sans', 'Helvetica Neue', sans-serif;" href= "https://www.patreon.com/guerrillahistory">https://www.patreon.com/guerrillahistory</a><span style="font-family: -apple-system, BlinkMacSystemFont, 'Segoe UI', Roboto, Oxygen, Ubuntu, Cantarell, 'Open Sans', 'Helvetica Neue', sans-serif;"> </span></p> <div id="highlighter--hover-tools" style="display: none;"> <div id="highlighter--hover-tools--container"> <div class="highlighter--icon highlighter--icon-copy" title="Copy">  </div> <div class="highlighter--separator"> </div> <div class="highlighter--icon highlighter--icon-delete" title= "Delete"> </div> </div> </div> <div id="highlighter--hover-tools" style="display: none;"> <div id="highlighter--hover-tools--container"> <div class="highlighter--icon highlighter--icon-copy" title="Copy">  </div> <div class="highlighter--separator"> </div> <div class="highlighter--icon highlighter--icon-delete" title= "Delete"> </div> </div> </div> <div id="highlighter--hover-tools" style="display: none;"> <div id="highlighter--hover-tools--container"> <div class="highlighter--icon highlighter--icon-copy" title="Copy">  </div> <div class="highlighter--separator"> </div> <div class="highlighter--icon highlighter--icon-delete" title= "Delete"> </div> </div> </div> <div id="highlighter--hover-tools" style="display: none;"> <div id="highlighter--hover-tools--container"> <div class="highlighter--icon highlighter--icon-copy" title="Copy">  </div> <div class="highlighter--separator"> </div> <div class="highlighter--icon highlighter--icon-delete" title= "Delete"> </div> </div> </div> <div id="highlighter--hover-tools" style="display: none;"> <div id="highlighter--hover-tools--container"> <div class="highlighter--icon highlighter--icon-copy" title="Copy">  </div> <div class="highlighter--separator"> </div> <div class="highlighter--icon highlighter--icon-delete" title= "Delete"> </div> </div> </div>]]></description>

      <description><![CDATA[<p>In this patreon-early access Intelligence Briefing, Adnan and Breht discuss the current moral panic on the political right around issues of masculinity, dropping testosterone levels, and family formation. Together they discuss how the Right obscures the role of under-regulated corporations in poisoning us and the role capitalism plays in destabilizing human life in general, and instead blame scapegoats like life-saving vaccines, innocuous food stuffs like soy, feminism, LGBTQ people, and liberal elites (but never reactionary ones ofc). In addition, they try to think through what masculinity actually is, how it might express itself in healthy ways, what the left can offer young people in general, how reactionary notions of masculinity are rooted in profound fear and insecurity, and how misogynistic figures in the manosphere actually hamstring and poison the minds of young men trying to find a good partner and build a meaningful life.</p> <p><span style= "font-family: -apple-system, BlinkMacSystemFont, 'Segoe UI', Roboto, Oxygen, Ubuntu, Cantarell, 'Open Sans', 'Helvetica Neue', sans-serif;"> Help support the show by signing up to our patreon, where you also will get bonus content:</span> <a style= "font-family: -apple-system, BlinkMacSystemFont, 'Segoe UI', Roboto, Oxygen, Ubuntu, Cantarell, 'Open Sans', 'Helvetica Neue', sans-serif;" href= "https://www.patreon.com/guerrillahistory">https://www.patreon.com/guerrillahistory</a><span style="font-family: -apple-system, BlinkMacSystemFont, 'Segoe UI', Roboto, Oxygen, Ubuntu, Cantarell, 'Open Sans', 'Helvetica Neue', sans-serif;"> </span></p>]]></description>
