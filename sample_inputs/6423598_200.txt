      <itunes:title><![CDATA[Dogen: “Not knowing is most intimate.” July 5, 1987]]></itunes:title>
      <description><![CDATA[<p>Zen Roshi, Lola McDowell Lee, explains the story of Dogen Zenji, the founder of the Soto Zen school in Japan. One master says, “Not knowing is most intimate.”</p><p>Dogen’s question: if we are already Buddha nature — if enlightenment is our essence — then why do we need to seek it?</p><p>When Dogen returned to Japan, he founded the Soto school and taught <em>Shikantaza</em> — just sitting. This practice, Lola explains, is single-minded meditation without striving or grasping — simply allowing truth to reveal itself.</p><p>Meditation, explains Lola, is about resting in awareness, with nothing held back. The nature of mind. It’s both the source of our bondage and the key to our liberation. We must move beyond the “content” of the mind — our thoughts, dreams, and desires — to see mind itself, the clear space in which everything appears.</p><p>No-mind is not the absence of awareness but awareness without clutter. It is the crystal-clear state when the activity of thinking subsides.</p><p>We need to observe carefully: subject and object, thinker and thought, self and world. As one sees how all phenomena are like dreams, the sense of self begins to dissolve. Awakening brings clarity and wonder — colors seem brighter, the world more alive, even rocks appear to breathe.</p><p>Lola warns that the ego can cling to enlightenment experiences. The final task, she says, is to “let go of the remedy” — to release attachment to spiritual methods once they’ve served their purpose. Like the five men carrying a boat instead of realizing they’ve already crossed the river. </p><p>The teachings from Rinzai Zen are about the four positions in the relationship between ego and True Self, host and guest, questioner and answerer.</p><p>Enlightenment isn’t somewhere else to reach. It’s here, now, in the clear seeing that <em>truth is</em>.</p><p>July 5, 1987</p>]]></description>

      <itunes:title><![CDATA[How you form your ego—and can ultimately overcome it.  Jun 28, 1987]]></itunes:title>
      <description><![CDATA[<p>Zen Roshi, Lola McDowell Lee, tells a parable about a powerful Chinese prime minister, who was a devoted Zen student. When the minister asked his master, "how does Zen explain egotism?" the master insulted him, calling him a "numbskull". As the minister's face filled with anger and hurt feelings, the master smiled and said, "Your Excellency, this is ego".</p><p>Lola explains that this ego is our very basic problem. Paradoxically, we need It presents we need the ego to function in the world, yet it is also our biggest stumbling block to discovering our true identity.</p><p>Most people, she says, are so caught up in this pseudo self that they don't even know how to begin looking for the True Self. She explains that the rules of Zen practice, such as the <em>sesshin</em>, are designed to force practitioners to observe oneself and one’s reactions.</p><p>Lola explains how the formation of the ego begins in infancy. A child, Lola says, is born like a <em>tabula rasa</em> or "clean slate." Everything—food, love, comfort—comes from out there. The sense of me is formed later, <em>in contrast</em> to “other". This "me" is a "reflected awareness". It is a reflective center built entirely from the opinions of others, starting with the mother. If the mother smiles and appreciates the child, the child feels valuable, and this positive reflection builds the ego . Conversely, if the mother ignores the child, the child feels worthless and rejected, which builds an "ill ego."</p><p>This ego is necessary. The True Self can only be known by passing through this ego. The path is to first know "other," then "me" (the reflection), and finally to see that reflection as the illusion it is.</p><p>As the child becomes an adult, the search for the true self begins, but it's often misguided. People look to religion, but with nearly 400 sects, they usually just pick one that reinforces what one already thinks—which reinforces the ego.</p><p>The great religious traditions all aim to show one, universal truth shared by great figures like Buddha and Jesus. The smaller sects tend to get lost in trappings.</p><p>This societal atmosphere we develop in helps form the ego. Lola explains there are two centers in each of us. The first is the <em>acquired center</em>, given to us by society and shaped by others. This is <em>not</em> direct experience. The second is the <em>true center</em>, which we are born with and is given by existence; this <em>is</em> direct experience . To glimpse the true center, the ego must be overcome.</p><p>Lola discusses a concept of "masks of the universe” from physicist Edward Harrison. Including, historically, the magic era, the mythic era, etc. (While this is after Lola’s time, it reminds me of a more primitive structure that scholar Ken Wilber later provides us more comprehensively).</p><p>Most of us are trapped in our own minds, which are full of intellectual nonsense and sentiments that make us miserable.</p><p>One way out, Lola concludes, is the Zen path, which requires persistent observation: one must really observe" oneself in action to see the source of one’s misery. Second is re-evaluating our values.</p><p>The goal is to reach a state of "just so." With values that are free from ego.</p><p>The parable about the Zen master Joshu and a stone bridge.</p><p>Jun 28, 1987</p>]]></description>

      <itunes:title><![CDATA[Zen and Socrates. Jun 21, 1987]]></itunes:title>
      <description><![CDATA[<p>Zen Roshi, Lola McDowell Lee, argues that most people waste their lives playing superficial games and are deceived by their own minds. They fail to engage in the urgent, life and death work of knowing themselves. The pursuit of money, power, prestige, and reputation are hollow endeavors, like waves on an ocean.</p><p>Lola draws parallels between Zen practice and the Socratic method. </p><p>Many of us meditate for a short period only to ignore one’s inner awareness for the other 23 hours of the day.</p><p>Lola describes Greek philosopher Socrates as a figure who masterfully employed a method of inquiry similar to that of Zen. Socratic questioning, like the Koan, was a tool to penetrate the world of appearances and challenge ingrained opinions. This method, like Zen, is not about adding new beliefs but about drawing out the truth that is already within.</p><p>Central to both the Socrates and Zen is in admitting ignorance. Plato depicted Socrates as a man whose wisdom lay in recognizing his own ignorance. </p><p>Lola parallels this with the Zen master Bodhidharma, who, when asked by an emperor who he was, famously replied, "I don't know". This "unknowing" is a powerful spiritual state that moves beyond concepts, opening a space for true, transformative knowing to emerge.</p><p>Ideas by themselves, even great spiritual ideas, do not raise the level of a human life. Without action by us, ideas have no real transforming power.</p><p>Jun 21, 1987</p>]]></description>

      <itunes:title><![CDATA[Instructions for Koan study. And true understanding & non-discrimination. May 31, 1987]]></itunes:title>
      <description><![CDATA[<p>Zen Roshi, Lola McDowell Lee, recounts the story of master Joshu who offers cups of tea to the various monks, illustrating the idea of how distinction keeps us from seeing the world as it is. When he offers the same tea to newcomers and long-time members alike, the manager asks why. And Joshu has a shouting response. Why?</p><p>Our scientific world breaks the world into bits, opreating within a framework of complexity and duality because seeing the simplicity of the whole is so difficult for us to grasp.</p><p>Zen teaches us the value of non-discrimination—the art of seeing things as they are, without interpreting or naming. Lola illustrates this with a personal anecdote about a wedding party where she presided—and the which they hoped would symbolize the couple’s eternal love. But the candle kept blowing out.</p><p>A tool for achieving this mental shift is the koan, and how it is not an intellectual puzzle to be solved. Rather, it is a device intended to exhaust the rational mind. The student should approach a koan" employing great faith, great resolution, and a great spirit of inquiry.”</p><p>The weakness of this duality-approach becomes clear when we look at many try to understand the notion of God. In doing so, many religions create the Devil to complement the notion of God.</p><p>The importance of awareness and alertness, and the meaning of the Japanese Tea Ceremony.</p><p>We must pass through the obstacle of our own discriminating minds to walk freely in the universe.</p><p>May 31, 1987</p>]]></description>

      <itunes:title><![CDATA[The limitations of human knowledge. May 17, 1987]]></itunes:title>
      <description><![CDATA[<p>Zen Roshi, Lola McDowell Lee, discusses human knowledge an its limitations. </p><p>Typical knowledge is the result of fragmented perception. Our knowledge is narrow, limited to appearances and governed by desire, habit, and subconscious impulses.</p><p>The relationship of Surya (divine light) and Agni (divine force). </p><p>Agni symbolizes will in consciousness. Together, Surya (knowing) and Agni (will) form a unity. Knowledge and Will are not separate. They are two aspects of the same foundation of reality.</p><p>The Upanishads say that sin is not moral condemnation but that which causes a deviation from the straight path. </p><p></p><p>Even elegant, dazzling thoughts can be a deviation, like a pebble blocking the sun. Each of us has our blind spots.</p><p>Jesus said, “The crooked shall be made straight.” The ideal is to find the direct way, the single eye that fills the whole house with light.</p><p>May 17, 1987</p>]]></description>

      <itunes:title><![CDATA[In the struggle between opposites is the Truth. Mar 6, 1987]]></itunes:title>
      <description><![CDATA[<p>Zen Roshi, Lola McDowell Lee, draws on Buddhist and Hindu traditions (including the Mahabharata, Ramayana and Bhagavad Gita) to explain the human condition.</p><p>Struggles and opposition are partners in our growth. Manjushri (wisdom) is not found in shrines, but is alive within each person.</p><p>Lola recounts a tale of a monk and the village courtesan.</p><p>She talks about how struggle is necessary for growth; it develops character. Friend and foe, like rose and thorn, are inseparable opposites. The human tendency is to focus on one side and ignore the other. True vision includes both opposites—and finding a center in the balance of them.</p><p>Lola discusses whether she thinks someone can be wealthy and still find enlightenment.</p><p>The true self is both presence and emptiness. The mystery of the self is real and should be made actual. Three spokes unite in one nave, and on that which is non-existent, the nave, depends the wheel's utility.</p><p>Clay is molded into a vessel, and on that which is non on its hollowness, depends the vessel's utility.</p><p>By cutting out doors and windows, we build a house. and on that which is nonexistent, on the empty space within, depends the house's utility.</p><p>Therefore, existence renders actual, but nonexistence renders useful.</p><p>Mar 6, 1987</p>]]></description>

      <description><![CDATA[<p>Note: Generally, this talk is more lighthearted than most that Lola gives. It’s nice to see that side of her personality.</p><p>Lola begins with a comical tale about a man and a priest he asks for advice.</p><p>Zen Roshi, Lola McDowell Lee, discusses Lao Tzu concept of how the hole in the wheel’s knave makes its utility. How the emptiness of a vessel creates its utility.</p><p>Lola asks, “Who would you rather be: a victim or a perpetrator?”</p><p>It is in the world of the Relative that we can discover the Absolute.</p><p>How freedom relates to relativity. Some people don’t want freedom. They’d rather follow directions.</p><p>The world is like a schoolroom where the teacher is absent. It is chaotic. Where is God?</p><p>She tells the story of Swami Vivekananda, who, during his first visit to the United States in 1893, was shunned for his skin color.  Eventually his speech at the Parliament of the World's Religions in Chicago brought him recognition in the US. </p><p>Lola explains how many spiritual seekers seek after miracles. But the world is full of miracles. A seed dies and falls into the ground and a tree grows from it. Grass grows. Look at man? He’s a miracle. The world is a manifestation of God.</p><p>Feb 28, 1987</p>]]></description>

      <description><![CDATA[<p>Zen Roshi, Lola McDowell Lee, discusses various texts about the notion of God — from the biblical book of Genesis to <em>Mystica Theologica</em> to the sutras of Patanjali.</p><p>Dionysus was a disciple of St. Paul and one-time mayor of Athens.</p><p>We eat from the Tree of Knowledge of Good and Evil… but we must return to the Tree of Life.</p><p>Buddhism did not identify God. Or a self. So for a Buddhist, what is there? Perhaps a Buddhist might say there is a Power greater than himself.</p><p>Why did God create the world as it is? How do you answer the question, “Why do you love the person you love?”</p><p>The wisdom of Patanjali, the author of many Sanskrit works including the Yoga Sutras. Yoga is the restraining from taking the many forms. Like a sculptor who removes parts of the stone to find the creation within.</p><p>We have blind spots in our seeing, and in our hearing. We also have blind spots in our thinking… caused by the many patterns we identify with. Like a sculptor, we must learn to identify these patterns to find what remains within us.</p><p>Darwin traveled the world in a big ship… and he came upon islanders who could not see his boat. It was too big.  If these islanders could not see a boat because it was too big, then how do we expect to see God?</p><p>That is why we meditate. To enter an area beyond our patterns, beyond our knowledge—to experience a kind of not knowing. We must give up our thoughts and identifications to experience this not-seeing. Then we can see the Truth of what we are.</p><p>Lola discusses the creation of the world in the biblical chapter of Genesis. What is the Light at the beginning? And what is the Light again on the fourth day?</p><p>Genesis 1:1-4 (King James version) - “In the beginning God created the heaven and the earth. And the earth was without form, and void; and darkness was upon the face of the deep. And the Spirit of God moved upon the face of the waters. And God said, Let there be light: and there was light. And God saw the light, that it was good: and God divided the light from the darkness.”</p><p>How this relate to Aurobindo’s poem, Savitri, that begins “"It was the hour before the Gods awake.”</p><p>The tale of a man of Athos who spoke to an apricot tree and it blossomed.</p><p>Jan 31, 1987</p>]]></description>

      <description><![CDATA[<p>Zen Roshi, Lola McDowell Lee, (who is also an ordained Christian minister) explores issues that are common to both Christian and Eastern thought to illustrate the difference between theology/philosophy and religious practice.</p><p>She explains that it is easier to join a religious group and hang around it than it is to truly struggle with oneself.  There are many who participate in religions just so they can tell themselves they are doing their religious duty. They learn a religious system or structure and think they have learned some truth. Not so.</p><p>Simply wishing will not change you. It requires effort. We must work to be sufficiently free of delusion—which makes us more pliable and receptive continue learning.</p><p>We live like a child in our father’s house—with little probing. We live under great, powerful laws of God’s will… but have we ever seen or truly understood these laws?</p><p>When is the last time you were in awe of nature? </p><p>The word “awful” used to mean being in awe. Now we think of it as something bad, to be feared. Feeling awe — of this mysterious thing we call life—to some it is joyful. To some it creates fear. </p><p>It can be your rock, your faith.</p><p>Philosophy rises from wonder. True religion arrives from awe.</p><p>Lola recounts the tale of the general who visits a teacher. His question for the teacher: What is it we use every day and don’t know? The teacher served him muffins and tea. </p><p>Try to stay in this awe—don’t rationalize it away. Jut remain in awe.</p><p>Jesus said, ““If anyone desires to come after Me, let him deny himself, and take up his cross, and follow Me.” (King James, Matthew 16:24).</p><p>This is conversion. </p><p>Lola tells a metaphorical story of God and an Old Man. God says to him that he receives nothing but endless requests for favors and things, so he wants to hide. He asks an old man, where can he hide? The old man tells him the perfect place to hide—is inside of man. Then those that seek him will only be able to succeed after a sincere investigation within themselves.</p><p>If someone asks you if God exists, what is your answer? Do most who say they are believers know it for a fact that He exists? Do atheists know for a fact He doesn’t? So what is one’s answer to be? It depends.</p><p>Lola tells a tale about a woman in India who clutched her baby during a flood and is saved from the flood. </p><p>Sep 20, 1987</p>]]></description>

      <itunes:title><![CDATA[A detailed introductory talk about the Bauls — a religious sect of India—and the mystery of consciousness. Sep 13, 1987]]></itunes:title>
      <description><![CDATA[<p>Note: Unfortunately these talks about the Bauls were posted out of order. But the sound quality is much better on this one, which is also the most detailed in its explanation of who the Bauls were. And this talk develops into a wonderful, rich discussion of consciousness.</p><p>Lola says that not many people have heard of the Bauls because they had no organization or dogma or scripture. They were freewheeling practitioners who loved dance, music and poetry—and looked within.</p><p>Zen Roshi, Lola McDowell Lee, explains how the Indian Bauls were a group of Hindus also were joined by a sect of Sufis when the Muslims invaded India.</p><p>The Bauls did not use the term “God.” They focused mainly on the “essential man within you.”</p><p>Baul literally means “affected by the winds.”</p><p>The doctrine of Shakti and the follower, or Shakta.</p><p>Shakti refers to the divine feminine cosmic energy and creative power that underlies all existence. It's the active principle of the Godhead, responsible for creating, sustaining, and dissolving the universe.</p><p>Shaktas, or believers in Shakti, felt that the ultimate divine being is best understood and worshipped as the feminine principle, and manifests in countless forms as different goddesses.</p><p>Lola recounts the story of Krishna’s origins, per the Bhagavad Gita.</p><p>Bhakti Yoga, the practice of devotion thru submission to find the secret knowledge.</p><p>Lola explains that Being and Awareness is like love. Love can only be known by loving. It can’t be described or taught, it needs to be experienced.</p><p>She extends the metaphor to swimming. You can’t be taught how to swim outside the water. But if you go into the water and can’t swim, you fear you’ll drown. So it seems like an impossible, paradoxical situation. Spiritual practice carries with it a similar paradox.</p><p>Lola discusses Ramana Maharshi.</p><p>She talks about how, when we sit in silence, one puts a downward pressure into that which is within us. Eventually that pressure releases something inside that allows one to become “a man of the heart.” The pressure allows the Being to overcome the Ego.</p><p>What is consciousness? That is, Lola says, the primary question of all religion. The search, in consciousness, to grow in consciousness. </p><p>Through observation and alertness… of all the activity within and without—we can stir a moment of clarity, of insight. In that flash of perception consciousness sees, and knows instantly what comes from within and what comes from without. </p><p>Sep 13, 1987</p>]]></description>

      <itunes:title><![CDATA[The Bauls religious sect of India. And Prakrit and Parusha. Oct 18, 1987]]></itunes:title>
      <description><![CDATA[<p>Note: this talk has some sound issues, but I found it valuable enough to include the bulk of it anyway. It’s about 8 minutes shorter because the cassette player apparently started warbling and slowing down badly at the end—during the discussion of <em>Prakrit </em>and <em>Parusha</em>. There is another talk on this subject available here if you are interested. It’s a fascinating doctrine.</p><p>Zen Roshi, Lola McDowell Lee, explores the accounts of the Indian Bauls - a religious group that included members of Vaishnava Hindus and Sufi Muslims.</p><p>They had a freewheeling spirit. And worshipped the Hindu goddess, Kali, the Divine Mother.</p><p>The Bauls sought after the meaning of the Novel Man, a concept not unlike the True Man of St. Paul.</p><p>Kali and Krishna. While many saw them as opposing forces, the Bauls worshipped them together, as complementary aspects of the divine.</p><p>We think we own our possessions, our thoughts, our beliefs--the more the better… but in reality they own us.</p><p>Our daily life and our Being coexist. But first comes Being.</p><p>Lola recounts the tale of the King and the Nun… the King makes her a queen, but even as queen, she continues to secretly pray to God.</p><p>The notion of the downward movement of <em>Prakrit</em> into the unconscious. Some people are afraid to push downward. But they need not be.</p><p>Like a scientist, we should see what we can discover inside—including our sensations and our feelings. </p><p>Zen’s goal is much like that of the Bauls, but Zen is more direct.</p><p><em>Prakrit</em> and <em>Purusha</em> are two fundamental and distinct principles that explain the nature of reality. All of nature comes about and is moved by the non-moving—like a magnet moves magnetized items on a board with an unseen power. While it appears the items on the board are active, they are not moving under their own power.</p><p>The entire universe is the unfolding — as the interaction between <em>Prakrit </em>and <em>Parusha</em>.</p><p>When you become unattached from <em>Prakrit</em>—then everything follows you. Like your shadow cast ahead of you when the is sun behind you—you try but cannot follow your shadow as it moves. But turn toward the sun — the Truth — and your shadow follows you.</p><p>Oct 18, 1987</p>]]></description>

      <itunes:title><![CDATA[Zen and the meaning of Easter. Apr 19, 1987]]></itunes:title>
      <description><![CDATA[<p>Zen Roshi, Lola McDowell Lee, gives a talk themed on Easter. (While Lola was primarily a Zen teacher, she was also an ordained Christian minister). </p><p>Lola reads from the Gospels exploring the meaning of Jesus asking, “Why have you forsaken me?”</p><p>Symbols of Easter include a baby chick, pecking its way out of an egg to become that which he was destined to be. That is also a good metaphor for the human situation.</p><p>Lola discusses various religious traditions, including that of the Mayans of Central America and Jewish Mysticism.</p><p>Nothing is taken away from the outer. And nothing is added to the inner. It is a union of the two. </p><p>Nirvana is Samsara — and Samsara is Nirvana. </p><p>The history of Constantine, the Roman emperor who became a Christian—and changed the world.</p><p>No one becomes truly religious on the order of another. We must see to it ourselves.</p><p>The story of Adam and the tree of good and evil—as well as the tree of life.</p><p>Who is the True Man that goes in and out of the gates of your face?</p><p>Jewish mysticism describes the Heart of Hearts, and the Heart of Stone. The internal battle. Our will can cut through the heart of stone… with a sword of truth. It takes a self-emptying of one’s self aggrandizement.</p><p>The meaning of Passover. </p><p>You have to empty yourself of your miseries… as well as your best parts.</p><p>Many of us pray for things, and removal of miseries… without praying (or meditating) to know God himself. It’s Spiritual Hedonism.</p><p>Apr 19, 1987</p>]]></description>

      <description><![CDATA[<p>Zen Roshi, Lola McDowell Lee, explores the meaning of Verse 15 of the Isha Upanishad:</p><p>"The face of Truth is covered with a brilliant golden lid; that do thou remove, O Fosterer, for the law of the Truth, for sight."</p><p>Lola discusses the prevalence of guilt in Puritanical America. How some of us feel guilt our entire lives, and how many, sometimes because of religious traditions, feel they shouldn’t enjoy life. We should look at this guilt, and try to understand it.</p><p>Meditation should not be an escape mechanism.</p><p>Buddha taught that it is not life that brings sorrow—but our demands on life that causes suffering. </p><p>Becoming Being… that is the end of desire and suffering. The more one feeds desire, the more it burns.</p><p>Lola discusses a poem byRabindranath when he was dying.</p><p>What is it in you that knows?</p><p>Lola discusses sex and celibacy and its relationship to religiosity.</p><p>She recounts the tale of two monks who encountered a young woman unable to cross a river. In spite of their vows, the monks carry the woman across the river and set her down. The younger monk later confronts the elder, troubled by having touched a woman in violation of their vows. The elder responds with the question, "I set her down on the other side of the river. Why are you still carrying her?"</p><p>Some people mistake the rejection of life as a sign of religiosity. When Siddhartha was fasting and emaciated, he had a few followers. When he finally asked to be fed, his followers abandoned him. When he wasn’t emaciated, they no longer found him an acceptable master.</p><p>We should look at the things we desire in life, our attachments, and see what we identify with. </p><p>The notions of Birth and Non-Birth. </p><p>The ego is very interested in one’s karma. When the actions of the mind are exhausted, then transcendence is possible. But we need the dissolution of the ego, and instead to identify with the Divine Being in us. Then that is liberation.</p><p>Lola May 3, 1987</p>]]></description>

      <description><![CDATA[<p>(Note: original recording audio is not ideal, but Lola's message is great)</p><p>Zen Roshi, Lola McDowell Lee, gives an ind-depth explanation of the practice of sitting, as this talk is during a sesshin at the temple.</p><p>Who is the Buddha? What is birth and death?</p><p>Zazen is learning about life by dying to one’s self. Be quietly alert, dropping the ego and identifications.</p><p>Our mistake is taking the phenomenal to be the noumenal. But they are really two aspects of the same thing.</p><p>Emotions confuse us and cause us pain. Learning how to sit with pain. Everyone has pain. Complaining about pain is your ego at work. One transcends pain by focusing and going beyond the phenomenal.</p><p>What do you want from your sitting practice? Instruction in meditation. Breath through the Hara to find the calm. Radiate your peace.</p><p>The evolution of Zen from India and Hinduism to Taoism and China to America, where we are now (in 1987) the new caretakers of the tradition.</p><p>The ringing of the bell as part of the transmission process.

What else?”</p><p>When we “do not know,” then we don’t concern ourselves with obsessions about outcomes. That is the meaning of “no mind.”</p><p>Start by discovering what “no mind” is not. </p><p>Is there a gradual acquisition of “no mind?” </p><p>Is there an enduring entity called self? Is there a self to improve? Do not accept of reject an answer without learning for yourself directly.</p><p>Is the thinker different than his thoughts?</p><p>Just like we have frames of images in our vision, which are just a series of flashes which we might think are continuous… so do we have a series of thoughts, a thinking mind, that we might think are continuous… but they are not. </p><p>How do we use the mind to study the mind? A knife cannot cut itself. How can you, living in time, know what time is?</p><p>The “I” that develops as one grows in childhood grasps at immediate wants. Then, eventually, it also wants to be socially accepted. Those two wishes cause conflict in us.</p><p>Your knowledge and memories are held in your subconscious.

      <description><![CDATA[<p>Zen Roshi, Lola McDowell Lee, discusses Chapter 10 from the Tao Te Ching (Paul Carus translation)</p><p>"What can be done?</p><p>"Who by unending discipline of the senses embraces unity cannot be disintegrated. By concentrating his vitality and inducing tenderness he can become like a little child. By purifying, by cleansing and profound intuition he can be free from faults.</p><p>"Who loves the people when administering the country will practice nonassertion.</p><p>"Opening and closing the gates of heaven, he will be like a mother-bird; bright, and white, and penetrating the four quarters, he will be unsophisticated. He quickens them and feeds them. He quickens but owns not. He acts but claims not. He excels but rules not. This is called profound virtue."</p><p>We often ask, “What is the purpose of life?”  Is it to make money? Have sex? Raise a family? Power? These are goals, but they are not the meaning of life.</p><p>He who lives with a purpose loses his life. What? Live with no purpose? </p><p>Learn to cope with yourself.</p><p>When your teacher asks, What is your original face? You do not want to tell him all your reasoning. You must show him.</p><p>If you learn there is no answer, then you’re free.</p><p>In logic there is the question: If the many return to the one, then to what does the one return?</p><p>The three questions the Emperor asked of Bodhidharma.</p><p>Yes, of course you will have goals. But remember to be present, in the <em>Now</em>, for <em>Now</em> is the day of the Lord. Don’t let your thoughts about the future or the past allow you to miss living today.</p><p>The question isn’t "What is the purpose of life?" The question is: How do we live this life… this gift of life we’ve received. That’s what matters.</p><p>Lola explores the notions of the masculine mind and the feminine mind in all of us. Aggressive versus Receptive. </p><p>The story of Socrates and the Sophist.</p><p>June 28, 1981</p>]]></description>

      <itunes:title><![CDATA[The role of patience in Zen practice. July 5, 1981]]></itunes:title>
      <description><![CDATA[<p>Zen Roshi, Lola McDowell Lee, explores the notion of patience in practice. And time.</p><p>For nearly twenty years, Hon, a layman, studied under Master Egon. Several of the students went out to the edge of the district and Hon looked up at the falling snow and said, “Snowflakes as nice as these do not fall elsewhere.”</p><p>We are all in such a hurry. But time is a state of mind—full of anxiety about the future and the past. If you are patient enough, you will not miss yourself. The Buddha sat and sat and sat… in no time.</p><p>Lola recounts the tale of the old man and the young man, traveling together to a gated village that closes when the sun goes down. They asked their boatsman if they could make it in time. He replied, “You can reach it if you don’t hurry.”</p><p>The young man hurried, and the old man just plodded along. When in his haste the young man fell into a ditch, the old man was too feeble to help him. So the old man continued on… and arrived at the village in just the nick of time.</p><p>If you wish to be spontaneous, you cannot pose. If you have posed your whole life. It won’t be easy to stop the habit.</p><p>Be silent and watchful—and aware—and you’ll be able to see your habits.</p><p>The story of the old man who was dying and asked his son to go find a teacher and learn to meditate. So the son goes to a teacher and says, “My father would like to see my meditative face before he dies. How long will it take?” “Three years answered the teacher. So the son asked, “What if I work really hard at it?” Then 30 years.</p><p>The five senses and the biblical reference to the single eye.</p><p>Those who know use words differently than those who do not know. The sense is not in the word—but in the user. </p><p>July 5, 1981</p>]]></description>

      <description><![CDATA[<p>Zen Roshi, Lola McDowell Lee, further explores the <em>Mystica Theoligica</em>.</p><p><strong>NOTE: LOLA HAS A BAD COLD TODAY AND A PERSISTENT COUGH. If that bothers you, please skip. But the content of the talk is worth the discomfort, in my opinion.</strong></p><p>Religious life is like a sculpture… best to take away from life that which is not Him rather than ascribe characteristics to Him.</p><p>Most of our thoughts and emotions are unconscious. And people think: Oh, how life without emotions and desire would be so colorless. But is that true?</p><p>Heraclitus preferred what he called “the dry soul.”</p><p>Gurdjieff once told Ouspensky that, for the most part, no one self-remembers. If you can do that, he said, you’re most of the way toward Being.</p><p>The ordinary want to be extraordinary. But the truly extraordinary appreciate the ordinary. Looking at a bird. A plant. Ordinary life.</p><p>If you feel pain during sitting, keep watching your body. You’ll learn things.</p><p>Instead of trying to be a better man, try to be a new man.</p><p>You have a stance in this world. What is it you are standing on? How many of your concepts and emotions are you clinging to? How much are you understanding correctly?</p><p>If you pay only lip service to the practice, it will not suffice. If you pay “hard sitting,” the True Self will know what you’re doing.</p><p>Dec 11, 1988</p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p>]]></description>

      <itunes:title><![CDATA[The meaning of the the Mystica Theoligica. Dec 4, 1988 ]]></itunes:title>
      <description><![CDATA[<p>Zen Roshi, Lola McDowell Lee, explores the meaning of the opening of the <em>Mystica Theoligica</em>.</p><p>“Thou Trinity beyond Being, direct us to the heights of mystical revelation, sublime beyond all thought and light, wherein the simple, absolute and immutable mysteries of Divine Truth are hidden in the translucent darkness of that silence which revealeth in secret. For this darkness, though of deepest obscurity, is yet radiantly clear, and though beyond touch and sight, it overfills our unseeing mind with splendors of transcendent beauty. This is my prayer….”</p><p>Lola does a deep dive into the meaning of the reference to the translucent darkness, and what it means in terms of our Zen practice.</p><p>We start believing in the world of twos, of duality, soon after birth. The dichotomy of virtue and sin. Where there is one, there is the other.</p><p>If you want to find God, you need to train your mind to observe, to look.</p><p>A discussion of Christian Zen in Japan and elsewhere. And what the term means.</p><p>Jacob Needleman’s book, <em>Lost Christianity, </em>about how Christianity took the path less mystical than Buddhism did.</p><p>A mystical event is an undisturbible insight. It presents itself gutlessly, innocent, in ignorance.</p><p>She notes that there are no proofs for Truth. We need to verify Truth for ourselves, through our own experience. We live in a mystery of mysteries, a mystery that can be experienced—but not through words. All the world has been created without a word.</p><p>Lola discusses the meanings of atheism, theism, and agnosticism. How the athiest speaks as if he knows. As does the theist. But usually neither really knows. The agnostic, while he may be a seeker, admits that he, as yet, does not know. And when he does, he doesn’t speak of it. We should keep that ignorance while seeking.</p><p>This meaning is not unlike that of Ikyu, about how one cannot explain it, or speak of it. It is the state of not-knowing that opens the door.</p><p>Lola talks about how we learn things at age 5 that we still believe to be true but that may not be so. She recounts a time when she was five walking in the snow from Church with her grandfather.</p><p>While therapy can get help clear up some childhood issues, it will not clear them all. Nor does it need to. Meditation will solve the small ones eventually.</p><p>What is real Prayer? Lola tells of a time, at 18, when she was in a bit of a pickle. How she tried praying, but her prayers were demands and not sincere.</p><p>Instead of making prayer a demand, we need to learn to just let go, and know that you, yourself, can do nothing. Admit hat you don’t know. Because the thinking mind will not find the answers. </p><p>Dec 4, 1988</p>]]></description>

      <itunes:title><![CDATA[Watch how you make your choices. Otherwise, how can you ever change? Nov 6, 1988]]></itunes:title>
      <description><![CDATA[<p>Zen Roshi, Lola McDowell Lee, recounts the tale of the Persian teacher who asked a disciple to place a bag of gold in the middle of a bridge. He is to find a poor man to cross the bridge. The man successfully crossed the bridge where there is a bag of gold which he desperately needs. But he missed the gold. He had been too afraid to open his eyes and never saw it.</p><p>Our problem is we think know our faults. But we close our eyes to them.</p><p>You seekers who want freedom… freedom from what?</p><p>Do you ever watch how you make your choices? Otherwise, how will you ever change?</p><p>In the Upanishads it says we are like some spiders who spin a web, which comes from inside us. And then when they are finished with the web, the swallow the web and put it back inside us.</p><p>A father put his five sons to a test. He asked them: “What is the most important thing about man? If you don’t answer correctly, you’ll fall dead.” Four of the five all studied the ones before them, but still fell dead. The fifth said the most important to realize is that we don’t learn. He lived.</p><p>You meditate for a while. You feel good about yourself so you take a break. Then you start to feel bad about yourself again, and start over. It is hard to change. We don’t learn easily.</p><p>Lola recounts the tale in the Mahabharata of the Pandava Brothers.</p><p>As Gurdjieff says, we are trapped in our habit patterns. The key is to realize you are repeating automatically. In order to stop, just watch yourself. Don’t think about it. Just watch. And look to change.</p><p>Notice how you are when you are alone. Then when you realize someone is watching, see how quickly you change. Why?</p><p>We need to move into the Unconditioned. From the. Known, the Conditioned, to the Unknown, the Unconditioned.</p><p>That’s why we use a Koan. It’s like a pebble dropped in us to exhaust our thinking, to move out of the Known into the Unknown. The Koan stays in us and continues to work on our psyches.</p><p>There are three movements: the first, the Known to the Known, is thinking.Second is the Known to the Unknown, which represents a moment of consciousness. And the third is the Unknown to the Unknown, which is supra-consciousness.</p><p>The other seed in us is Prajna, or wisdom. It is through Prajna that we move to the Unconditioned. Prajna is disrupted. Moving from the grasping to the no-grasping, and Emptiness, Non-Discrimination.</p><p>A koan from Pang: How does the ocean, which has no muscles or bones, hold up a 10,000 pound ship?

      <description><![CDATA[<p>Zen Roshi, Lola McDowell Lee, shares the tale of a student who asked his teacher why, after he had fasted and prayed for 30 years that he had still not found God. The teacher’s response: “You could sit for 100 years and it wouldn’t do any good. Selfishness is your barrier.”</p><p>Lola recounts a long letter to a Roshi where the practitioner listed all his thoughts about spirituality and the universe. The Roshi’s response: “You know too much.” Just accumulating words is not gonna do it.</p><p>If you acknowledge that you don’t know… then you can live with these fictions and not let them dominate you.</p><p>Are you truthful with yourself? Really truthful? The naked truth? We’ve lived with our fictions so long we start to believe they are reality.</p><p>Why, asks Lola, does Nature hide the light from us? Nature does not. The veil is ours.</p><p>Do you ever believe you are somebody special? Most of us have at various points in our lives, or in our days. We think that we—as individuals—are going to be enlightened. </p><p>Watch for your appearances to raise their heads. Then drop them.</p><p>Pay the price, which is to admit the truth.</p><p>If time is an issue with your meditation, then you’re not really meditating. If you ever have a real moment of true meditation, you’ll never complain again about time spent meditating.</p><p>Oct 30, 1988</p>]]></description>

      <description><![CDATA[<p>Zen Roshi, Lola McDowell Lee, continues her examination of Lao Tsu’s Tao Te Ching, now in Chapter 17.</p><p>"The great rulers - the people do not notice their existence;</p><p>The lesser ones - they attach to and praise them; </p><p>The still lesser ones - they fear them;</p><p>The still lesser ones - they despise them;</p><p>For where faith is lacking,</p><p>It cannot be met by faith.</p><p>Now how much importance must be attached to words!"</p><p>- Translated by <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href="http://www.egreenway.com/taoism/ttclztrans3.htm">Ch'u Ta-Kao</a></p><p>In today’s America, Lola’s exploration of Lao Tsu’s words are more relevant than ever.</p><p>The difference between true seeking and consolation.</p><p>The Bible says man is created in the image of God. What in us is in the image of God?</p><p>We often say, whatever happens is for the best. But is it? For the Witness, good and bad outcomes in the usual sense don’t matter. He is not involved.</p><p>We convince ourselves of a false contentment, even when outcomes are not good for us. But that is not true equanimity.</p><p>Lola recounts the tale of the fox and the grapes.</p><p>The ego fulfills itself by any method. You say something to yourself long enough, you start to believe it. DO NOT DECEIVE YOURSELF.</p><p>As the Bible says, “come out from among them, and be ye separate…” It is not telling us to be our egos, but to be our True Self.</p><p>Zazen is an understanding of reality that does not come as the result of analysis. It is direct perception from the <em>noesis</em>.</p><p>***</p><p><strong>During the last fifteen minutes of Lola’s talk she focuses on the internal process during our meditation practice.</strong></p><p>Lola explores the Law of Interdependence. Relationships coming together, then parting, and how when conditions are right, the threads come together.</p><p>If you truly observe yourself during your sitting, you move from thought to thought, from thought to no-thought, from no-thought to no-thought, and so one. To and fro. In this movement you pass through the <em>Ku</em>, the zero. Do you see it? <em>Ku</em> and <em>Shiki</em>.</p><p>If you meditate for one hour daily, if you truly concentrate, you can merge with the <em>Ku</em>.</p><p>When a person becomes a Being instead always Becoming, then the true individual can shine through.</p><p>Jul 31, 1988</p>]]></description>

      <description><![CDATA[<p>Zen Roshi, Lola McDowell Lee, goes into considerable detail early and late in the talk about meditation to help prepare students for a sesshin.</p><p>Lola talks about how the subject and object become one. One sitting.</p><p>Master Gutei and his One-finger Zen.</p><p>Lola discusses various teachings involving the monastery’s Tenzo, or cook. And why this is a very advanced position within the system.</p><p>She recounts the tale of Dogen Zenji and the cook, and why the cook couldn’t continue his conversation with the master and needed to return to his kitchen. “My duty. My pleasure.” The Tenzo is not just a cook. His practice is in the kitchen, his activities, as ours should be in all our own.</p><p>To be of service to others—is service to God.</p><p>Sitting, by itself, is not enough. One must do good. A secret service, not for acclaim, but just for the sake of goodness.</p><p>“If not me, then who?</p><p>If not now, then when?”</p><p>We are our own lifetime project. Open your heart to yourself and your mind to yourself. That is Zen.</p><p>Exploration of a portion of the Diamond Sutra—how all composite things are like a dream, a bubble and a shadow.

Today, Chapter 16 (Suzuki translation)</p><p>     By attaining the height of abstraction we gain fulness of rest.</p><p>     All the ten thousand things arise</p><p>     And I see them return. </p><p>     Now they bloom in bloom </p><p>     But each one homeward returneth to its root.</p><p>     Returning to the root means rest.</p><p>     It signifies the return according to destiny. </p><p>     Return according to destiny means the eternal. </p><p>     Knowing the eternal means enlightenment. </p><p>     Not knowing the eternal causes passions to rise; and that is evil.</p><p></p><p>     Knowing the eternal renders comprehensive. </p><p>     Comprehensiveness renders broad. </p><p>     Breadth renders royal. </p><p>     Royalty renders heavenly. </p><p>     Heaven renders Reason-like. </p><p>     Reason renders lasting. </p><p>     Thus the decay of the body implies no danger.</p><p>—</p><p>Lola explains the rather harsh reality that we are not as important as we make ourselves out to be.</p><p>Desires need the Self to exist. The Self, however, can exist without desires.</p><p>The sky can exist without clouds, but clouds cannot exist without the sky.</p><p>When clouds cover the sky, only clouds can be seen. When Self is covered by desires, the Self cannot be seen. And the same thoughts and desires cloud us over and over again.</p><p>The sky doesn’t care if there are clouds or not. Clouds come and go.</p><p>What is your image of your Self? The True Self has no purpose. “The True Self leaves no trace,” says Lola. “I will leave no trace.”</p><p>Lola recounts the tale of the teacher and the monk. The teacher tells him to open just one eye, which he does. Then the teacher says, “Who taught you how to open one eye?” </p><p>Lola recounts her time in a Japanese monastery. </p><p>What is inaction? Any method implies an action.  How to meditate. There is no action required—simply a shift in consciousness. Don’t make it so difficult.</p><p>There’s a physical eye. A dharma eye. And a Buddha eye. Each has its own domain.</p><p>Lola recounts the tale of the emperor who, with all his soldiers and all his palaces, was still frightened about dying. Then a wise man gave him an amulet with a message inside.</p><p>Jul 3, 1988</p><p></p>]]></description>

      <description><![CDATA[<p>Zen Roshi, Lola McDowell Lee, continues her exploration of the Tao Te Ching. Today, Chapter 15:</p><p>     The ancient masters were subtle, mysterious, profound, responsive.</p><p>     The depth of their knowledge is unfathomable.</p><p>     Because it is unfathomable,</p><p>     All we can do is describe their appearance.</p><p>     Watchful, like men crossing a winter stream.</p><p>     Alert, like men aware of danger.</p><p>     Courteous, like visiting guests.</p><p>     Yielding, like ice about to melt.</p><p>     Simple, like uncarved blocks of wood.</p><p>     Hollow, like caves.</p><p>     Opaque, like muddy pools.</p><p></p><p>     Who can wait quietly while the mud settles?</p><p>     Who can remain still until the moment of action?</p><p>     Observers of the Tao do not seek fulfilment.</p><p>     Not seeking fulfillment, they are not swayed by desire for change.</p><p>—</p><p>How many of our daily acts are done with awareness?</p><p>We have the tendencies we were born with and the conditioning established through our lives. How we walk across the icy stream of life—our methods and tendencies are less important than our alertness.</p><p>How does a Holy Man walk? We can see that each walks differently. Yet their awareness, which we cannot see, is the same.</p><p>People recognize us by how we act. So often we choose to act so that we look good to others. We act like Jesus. Or the Buddha. But we have it backwards.</p><p>When we find a depth of awareness, right actions will follow.</p><p>We must learn ignore our concepts, our ideas, to be free. Including the ones you know about and those you are unconscious of.</p><p>Does your True Self know how hard you work to be good? We all want to find heaven and bring our best qualities along with us. We must drop our luggage—and concentrate on an inner awareness.</p><p>When you make a resolution—who do you make it to? Many develop a rigidity—in order to adhere to their resolutions. And when we fail, guilt develops. Learn to vacillate, be flexible. Then there is no need for guilt. If you are not naturally kind, or generous, then rigid vows to be so will not help. If you need vows, look within to discover why.</p><p>We seek security--safety, a home, etc. But animals in the wild are not secure. They must be alert at all times. Their lives depend on it. Learn about death while you’re still alive.</p><p>The tale of the Emperor who, looking for a Holy Man, finds a beggar.</p><p>May 28, 1988</p>]]></description>

      <description><![CDATA[<p>Zen Roshi, Lola McDowell Lee, provides a detailed exploration of Chapter 14 of Lao Tzu’s Tao Te Ching, “Praising The Mysterious.” In it Lao Tzu calls Reason the form of the formless. Reason’s clue.</p><p>But if we can’t touch it or see it, how are we to understand it? Don’t to endow it with qualities. Don’t describe it. It may appear bright, but it is simply reflecting our brightness.  But that is only what we perceive. It is, itself, not bright. </p><p>Our perception is limited. We perceive in twos. But the Tao is one. So how do we see it? To understand the world with the intellect…we compare, etc. But that is all abstraction.</p><p>Light is limited. But darkness has no boundaries. When light hits a prism, it becomes a rainbow of colors. Take the prism away and the colors disappear. But we love colors and are captivated by them.</p><p>They say, “If you meet the Buddha on the road, kill him.” That’s because if you see him, it is not him. You can’t see him. Like the Neti Neti approach, when we sit we discard all we hear. Until we reach the inaudible.</p><p>Lola recounts a tale from the Upanishad of a father who instructs his son to visit a guru and find the inaudible. The son goes to the guru and asks to know the inaudible. The guru sends him into the forest with 400 cows. “Return when they become 1000.” The son goes off into the forest and spends all his time serving the needs of the cows. Eventually, he returns to his father… to remarkable result.</p><p>Jesus said: If you have eyes, then see.  Lola asks: what do you think you are looking at?</p><p></p><p>May 8, 1988</p>]]></description>

      <itunes:title><![CDATA[Lao Tzu on two fundamental types of meditation. May 1, 1988]]></itunes:title>
      <description><![CDATA[<p>Zen Roshi, Lola McDowell Lee, gives a detailed explanation of Lao Tzu’s notion that there are two basic types of meditation one should practice. One of emptiness only, and one of concentration.</p><ol><li><strong>Sitting with pure, empty mind:</strong></li></ol><p>The first he described as meditating without desire. Chuang-Tzu called it “just sitting and forgetting” meditation. During this practice, we empty the mind of all impediments and sit with only pure mind. Easier said than done. Most of us sit, and only once in a while do e actually meditate. Most of us don’t want to really sit because we don’t want to give up anything.</p><p>To sit this way, just empty, it does not mean to blank out, or be unconscious. Just be quiet, still, every day. In the Pure Mind. When the mind is empty, Lao Tzu says it is like still water. It can then reflect. Without thoughts, which are activity, disturbances in the water. The clearness of the mind already exists.</p><p>It is this we often call the mirror mind, that mind which is clear, empty, and able to reflect. Then we can become that mirror.</p><p>2. <strong>Using the Pure Mind to concentrate on something</strong>—a word, a sound, a question.</p><p>Lao Tzu suggests also using a second method where we focus, and develop our concentration.</p><p>He says we should use both methods of meditation. Learn to find the Pure Mind. And use it to focus.</p><p>Plotinus, a Neo-platonist, had similar thinking to Lao Tzu in 250 A.D.</p><p>“The perfect and unchangeable life of the Divine Spirit overflows in an incessant stream of creative activity, which spends itself only when it has reached the lowest confines of being, so that every possible manifestation of Divine energy, every hue of the Divine radiance, every variety in degree as well as in kind, is realized somewhere and somehow. And by the side of this outward flow of creative energy there is another current which carries all the creatures back toward the source of their being. It is this centripetal movement that directs the active life of all creatures endowed with Soul. They were created and sent into the world that they might be moulded a little nearer to the Divine image by yearning for the home which they have left. This aspiration, which slumbers even in unconscious beings, is the mainspring of the moral, intellectual, and aesthetic life of mankind.</p><p>Lola explains that many look to our outward life to find fulfillment. In creating, achieving, jobs, creating families. But ultimately, fulfillment, she says, is found within.</p><p>But life should not be just one or the other. We should find fulfillment in both the outer and the inner.</p><p>How does an oyster know to open itself in order to eat? It doesn’t think. What about the oyster knows to do that?</p><p>When we look in the eyes of a cat or dog, or bird, we can, if we know how to look, see that divine miracle within them too. We should be in awe of life. But we’re usually not. Our pure intelligence is clouded by our thoughts.</p><p>As Jesus said, “Eye has not seen, nor ear heard, Nor have entered into the heart of man. The things which God has prepared for those who love Him.”</p><p>Allow your intelligence to become wisdom.</p><p>May 1, 1988 </p>]]></description>

      <itunes:title><![CDATA[More Bible parables that can help you practice Zen. Dec 12, 1984]]></itunes:title>
      <description><![CDATA[<p>Zen Roshi, Lola McDowell Lee, who is also an ordained Christian minister, continues her exploration of Christian parables and how they might apply for Zen practitioners.</p><p>Jesus spoke, in the book of Luke 5:36-39:</p><p>“And no man putteth new wine into old bottles; else the new wine will burst the bottles, and be spilled, and the bottles shall perish. But new wine must be put into new bottles; and both are preserved.”</p><p>Your life can be life-denying or life-affirming.</p><p>You can be religious without being part of any organized religion. Being truly religious is an internal practice.</p><p>Meister Eckhart’s mystical interpretation of the Biblical parables of the Virgin and the Christ.</p><p>Whatever you do in work, do it with love. It’s easy to swing between love and hate. You become what you love, but you also become what you hate.</p><p>Lola explores the meaning of Matthew 25:13 - “...always stay awake and be alert, because you don't know the day or the hour when the Bridegroom will appear.”</p><p>Lola Dec 12, 1984 </p>]]></description>

      <itunes:title><![CDATA[Bible parables that can help you practice Zen. Dec 9, 1984]]></itunes:title>
      <description><![CDATA[<p>Zen Roshi, Lola McDowell Lee, who is also an ordained Christian minister, discusses parables from the Bible and how they can help Zen practitioners.</p><p>Understanding Jesus’ parables is like puzzling with Zen koans. We reach a point with the puzzles and allows them, like a diamond cutter, to work on us. And eventually, in a new state, we begin to understand.</p><p>We are free. Yet we have no freedom. It’s a paradox. The freedom within, unforced, allows us to mature. But we can choose to ignore the within. We are also free to choose the adventure within.</p><p>Your choices in this world create your personality. What you become by the end of your life—that you have chosen. Yet, what we are born with affects our choices. We are seeds. How we live that growth is our destiny.</p><p>Lola discusses the historical meanings of the word sin from the Egyptian and the Greek. From the Greek, to miss.</p><p>A parable, and a koan, is like a bridge between the Truth and our unconscious selves.</p><p>We call ourselves human beings. But we are not yet. We are seeds.</p><p>To illustrate, Lola presents Jesus’ parable of the weeds:</p><p>“Jesus told them another parable: “The kingdom of heaven is like a man who sowed good seed in his field. But while everyone was sleeping, his enemy came and sowed weeds among the wheat, and went away. When the wheat sprouted and formed heads, then the weeds also appeared.</p><p>“The owner’s servants came to him and said, ‘Sir, didn’t you sow good seed in your field? Where then did the weeds come from?’</p><p>“‘An enemy did this,’ he replied.</p><p>“The servants asked him, ‘Do you want us to go and pull them up?’</p><p>“‘No,’ he answered, ‘because while you are pulling the weeds, you may uproot the wheat with them. Let both grow together until the harvest. At that time I will tell the harvesters: First collect the weeds and tie them in bundles to be burned; then gather the wheat and bring it into my barn.’”</p><p>How are we to interpret this? asks Lola.</p><p>Lola say to look within—and wait. But don’t wait with the old you. That’s your ego waiting. Let go of your attitudes. They’re not important during meditation. Only when a cup is empty can it be filled.</p><p>Let gratitude well up in you. Sit, and eventually the door opens and light comes in. You don’t bring it in.</p><p>Lola Dec 9, 1984 </p>]]></description>

      <description><![CDATA[<p>Zen Roshi, Lola McDowell Lee, explains that enlightenment is not a goal. “A goal is like the horizon. You can never reach it.”</p><p>The immediate is the ultimate. You have to be aware and wake up to this moment. This moment is eternity.</p><p>Human beings do a lot of unconscious abstracting. Lola explains.The teacher asks, “Do I have a staff or do I not have a staff?” The monk tries to answer in different ways. Finally he is so frustrated he gives up and leaves. He wanders for 12 years and finally returns to the teacher. He repeats the question to the teacher who responds with, “Is that what I said? How silly of me.”</p><p>Zen is not a belief system. The purpose of Zen is to disturb the dreaming mind. It is a method to awaken. The puzzles in Zen are intended to create such a strain in you that you cannot ignore.</p><p>Lola recounts the tale of the monk who repeatedly notices his teacher worshiping a statue of the Buddha. He asks him, “Why do you sit there and worship the Buddha? The teacher answers that it is because I like worshiping the Buddha. The monk then asks, “Why do you like worshipping the Buddha?” The monk continues to ask him question after question about this subject which puzzles him. Then the teacher gets up and slaps him.</p><p>Why did the teacher do that, asks Lola.Zen teachers try to create a fire in the monk’s cauldron, a pot in his gut. The monk’s mind is tethered. So the teacher allows question after question… until he runs out of questions. Then the slap.</p><p>Lola explains, “When you come to me with questions and I answer them, it does nothing for your consciousness, you’re being. It just gives you more stuff in your head.”</p><p>Zen is a milieu, and atmosphere, in which to better understand yourself. When you truly practice, you are in the milieu, the Work. And you have made yourself available to God.</p><p>Nov 12, 1984 </p>]]></description>

      <description><![CDATA[<p>Zen Roshi, Lola McDowell Lee, explains that when you sit properly in meditation, your world is gone. You are alone. Absolutely alone. And when you learn to accept this <em>alone</em>, it builds a great strength. Find that alone—and accept it.</p><p>She asks: you know all about your history, your friends, your work… but do you know you?</p><p>Without that light within you—that forgotten light—there would be no you. It is the reason you exist.</p><p>Many of us—at 40, or 50, or 60—hold the same image of God that we developed at age 5 or 10. Childish beliefs. Philosophies and beliefs make you feel better. But they are avoidances.</p><p>During troubling times—like during war—people start believing. God is an escape for them.</p><p>Master Ummon is asked about the four virtues of the Nirvana Sutra: Immutability, Joy, Personal Existence and Purity. Ummon picked up a cup and asked, “How many virtues has this?” “None at all,” the monk answered.</p><p>Ummon suggested the monk best go on with his lectures about the Sutra.</p><p>Ummon practices only one virtue: existence value.</p><p>The garden of your mind is full of beautiful flowers—and weeds. We need to explore it all. But that takes time. We have time for movies and gossip and football—but not to meditate.</p><p>If you stop puffing up your ego, it will shrink. Which is good, because eventually death will destroy it. This causes us anguish. But with practice, it doesn’t need to.</p><p>Nov 5, 1984 </p>]]></description>

      <description><![CDATA[<p>Zen Roshi, Lola McDowell Lee, asks how someone like Hitler could come to power. He was loud, and brash, and gave a secure feeling of strength to those who were insecure.</p><p>Lola recounts the tale of the Turkish teacher who travels to foreign lands and gathers quite a following. Until some Turks happen onto him and hear the nonsense he speaks. This, she says, is often how we talk to ourselves. We can deceive ourselves for years.</p><p>She also presents portions of an Ikkyu poem:</p><p>“The crescent moon</p><p>Becomes full, and wanes,</p><p>And nothing is left;</p><p>But still, there in the dawn,</p><p>The crescent moon!”</p><p>Lola discusses Jesus’ line from John 1:9, about the Light that cometh into the world… is the true Light that lighteth every man.</p><p>It is the light within us.</p><p>Mankind has, in a sense, fallen asleep to this inner light. We’ve forgotten who we are, as we continue to be mesmerized by the ten thousand things of the world.</p><p>When you fall in love, you feel good. It strengthens your identity. Same goes when you are popular, or successful. It feels good because it strengthens your identity. But that identity is not you. That’s just how you identify yourself objectively. You are identified with all kinds of things. Patters of thinking, feeling, from your childhood and on—all of which have authority over you. Yet none of these things you identify with say anything about the real you.</p><p>Who are you really? Your name is not you. Your photo is not you. Who are you?</p><p>Lola discusses similar ideas from numerous thinkers, including Sri Aurobindo about how we have grown a riddle to ourselves. Also the last words of German theologian, Bonhoeffer, shortly before his execution.</p><p>Lola tells the humorous story of the forgetful philosopher who, one morning, decided to label absolutely everything so he won’t forget. In the morning he awakens and it’s a grand success. He can find everything in its place… but suddenly panicked when he can’t find himself.</p><p>Everyone will need to answer the question: Who am I? Until that question becomes so magnificent—but terrifying—you haven’t really asked it yet.</p><p>Oct 28, 1984 </p>]]></description>

      <description><![CDATA[<p>Zen Roshi, Lola McDowell Lee, reads from renowned Zen teacher, Ikkyu: “If it rain, let it rain; If it rain not, let it not rain; But even should it not rain, You must travel with wet sleeves.”</p><p>What is religion? It is an inquiry into yourself.</p><p>The German theologian, Meister Eckhart, once wrote, “There is an agent in the soul, untouched by time. . . God Himself is that agent.</p><p>Keep looking inside a seed, you’ll find nothing. Because its essence is invisible. It is there, however, that Truth abides.</p><p>We are looking for nothingness, Lola notes, laughing, “Nothing doesn’t give you much to look for, does it?” But she adds, “Thou art that.”</p><p>If you are sure you know something, then how would you ever seek it? Search for nothing at all. Just ask, What is here?</p><p>The missing 18 years of Jesus’ life, from age 12 to 30. What did he do?</p><p>Life without choice.</p><p>Bankei: “There can be no death for what was never born, so if it is unborn, it is obviously undying. There is no need to say it, is there?”</p><p>Lola explains that we need to learn to watch everything, even our pains. Our tummy aches. Our head aches. Be the watcher. For then you’ll be better prepared to watch your death.</p><p>Oct 21, 1984 </p>]]></description>

      <description><![CDATA[<p>Zen Roshi, Lola McDowell Lee, relates the tale of the monk who questions Chuang Tzu. He begins:</p><p>Monk: "Much of what you talk about is that which is not of use to us."</p><p>Chuang-Tzu: "Most of the earth is no use to you."</p><p>Yin and Yang. Two archetypical poles of Nature. Male and female.Yin is quiet, intuitive. Yang is strong, creative, active. We must come to know the other to be in balance.</p><p>We constantly swing between Yin and Yang. Aristotle said that we mostly ignore the middle.</p><p>What does a house consist of? Walls make it actual. The seemingly non-existent, empty space inside is what makes it useful. Windows and doors let light in. Keep your eyes and ears open. They are our windows and doors.</p><p>Like a vessel—its utility is in its emptiness. Existence renders actual. Non-existence renders useful.</p><p>The same is true of us, such as our emptiness within.</p><p>Lola also asks: Where does the mind go when you sleep?</p><p>Lao-Tzu: Non-action is not doing nothing. </p><p>Oct 7, 1984</p>]]></description>

      <itunes:title><![CDATA[How can Truth be expressed without speaking—and without  being silent? Sep 30, 1984]]></itunes:title>
      <description><![CDATA[<p>Zen Roshi, Lola McDowell Lee, tells of the puzzled monk who visits Master Fuketsu. He asks, "How can Truth be expressed without speaking—and without being silent?"</p><p>Lao Tzu said, he who speaks does not know. And he who knows does not speak.</p><p>Then there is the Maha Mudra, or the great gesture.</p><p>When you hear a word from a master, there is a silence in the word.</p><p>A portion of the great poem by Sri Aurobindo:</p><p><strong>The Hour Before The Gods Awake</strong></p><p>It was the hour before the Gods awake.</p><p>Across the path of the divine Event</p><p>The huge foreboding mind of Night, alone</p><p>In her unlit temple of eternity,</p><p>Lay stretched immobile upon Silence' marge.</p><p>Almost one felt, opaque, impenetrable,</p><p>In the sombre symbol of her eyeless muse</p><p>The abysm of the unbodied Infinite;</p><p>A fathomless zero occupied the world.</p><p>—-</p><p>Lola explains the tale of the king who summoned the 27th Patriarch, Prajnatara, to perform a recitation. But when the master arrived, he remained silent, letting his attendant do the reciting, which, at first, upset the king. And what happened when Prajnatara spoke to the king’s three princes. And who the youngest prince became.</p><p>The next time you’re bothered about something, suggests Lola, just let your breathing remain natural. And see what happens.</p><p>Then Lola rings her bell, and asks, How do you awaken when you hear the bell? Don’t think. Just listen. Listen not with the ears. Listen with the Mind.</p><p>Sep 30, 1984 </p>]]></description>

      <description><![CDATA[<p>Zen Roshi, Lola McDowell Lee, recounts the story of the family where every member was enlightened. A visitor asked the father, “Is Zen difficult?” The father answered, “Yes, very.” The visitor then asked the son the same question. “No, it’s not difficult at all,” the son said. Then he asked the daughter. She answered, “If you make it difficult, it is difficult. If you make it easy, it is easy.”</p><p>Actions do not change your being. The periphery does not change the center.</p><p>The truth is found in the now, the present. If you are looking for it in another world, you’ll miss it here.</p><p>Look with an undivided eye, and undivided consciousness. Because Samsara is Nirvana, and Nirvana is Samsara.</p><p>Whatever you do, when you do it in silence, real silence, then God is there. All day long you are becoming, as you look toward your future. Instead of just being. The future, however, will never arrive. It’s a projection.</p><p>Life, for us, has no beginning or ending. We are always in the middle.</p><p>Also, Lola presents a detailed discussion of the Mu koan.</p><p>Sep 23, 1984 </p>]]></description>

      <description><![CDATA[<p>Zen Roshi, Lola McDowell Lee, interprets passages of Chuang Tzu, the great Taoist master.</p><p>The greatest man is nobody. The man of Tao does not cultivate his manner. Nor does he try not to.</p><p>Our mind moves in one direction—then swings the opposite way. The most difficult thing to do is to keep the mind in the middle.

      <description><![CDATA[<p>Zen Roshi, Lola McDowell Lee, explains how nature wants balance. If conditions swing one way, they eventually swing the other way.</p><p>Human nature is the same. If you strive in one direction about something, then the other direction eventually swings back at you.</p><p>For example, those who strive to be 100% moral often succumb to immorality. We see this often.</p><p>As is human nature, we swing in a swirl of thoughts and emotions, crossing the middle, or zero. That is the spot that is great to discover.</p><p>In each of us there is the feminine and the masculine. Men need to find their feminine side, and women their masculine.</p><p>We always want more light, less darkness. But we will never succeed at that. Life is both.</p><p>Don’t run to, and don’t run away. Being free of the sway is equanimity.</p><p>We all are interdependent — one one another. Because, in reality, we are one consciousness. One awareness.</p><p>Lola reads passages from the Bhagavad Gita that illuminates this theme.Aug 7, 1988</p>]]></description>

      <description><![CDATA[<p>Zen Roshi, Lola McDowell Lee, explains how when you first meditate, thoughts of your day may fill your mind. But eventually, you will experience a silence.</p><p>God isn’t going to talk to you in words. He has no mouth.</p><p>Junaid, a Sufi Master, seemed an ordinary laborer. And one of his young apprentices often wanted to display his great knowledge of things. Junaid says, “I am not so young as to know so much.”</p><p>When you know that you do not know, that is when you are most receptive to wisdom.</p><p>Mencius said that people are basically compassionate. The way of searching it to look for the mind and heart that you’ve let go of.</p><p>But many naturally find this paradoxical: how can a mind whose function is to think—not think.</p><p>One day Chuang Tzu took a nap under a tree. And his fellow travelers noticed how uneasy he was in his sleep. When they woke him he said he had dreamt he was a butterfly. They laughed, but he remained deeply troubled. “If I can dream I am a butterfly, then why should I not think that perhaps it is the butterfly that now sleeps and dreams she is Chuang Tzu. This, Lola says, is a tremendous koan.</p><p>Sometimes you unwittingly experience No Mind. When there is not thought in your mind, where is your mind? Mind with thought in it is stopped. Mind with no thought is ever flowing.</p><p>Meister Eckhart says if you forget and ignore self-consciousness, it is in the stillness, and silence that the word of God is heard. Once must achieve un-self consciousness by means of transformed knowledge. That is called ignorance. But it is not from lack of knowledge that the ignorance is found. It is from knowledge that it comes. It is by what happens to us, not by what we do, that we are transformed.</p><p>The tale of the rich man who called all the laborers to work at his farm. Some came in the morning and worked all day, some in the afternoon, some at night… but he paid them all the same. They complained.</p><p>When there is no mind, there is no sinner or saint. Grace comes to all as a gift.</p><p>Desires are forms. When enlightenment comes, these desires, which are energies, don’t disappear… they become formless.</p><p>Sep 9, 1984 </p>]]></description>

He sets out a water jug and says, “Without using its name, what do you call it?”</p><p>Without a word, without a thought, answer this question: Who are you? Without using a word, show what reality is. You can’t use a word or concept without using your mind. Philosophy is of the mind. Religion is of action. Thoughts are just a small part of you. Between n all your picking and choosing of thoughts, who are you?</p><p>Don’t expect rewards for meditation or living in the moment.</p><p>In order to understand the real universe, you need to lose the sense of the unreal world.</p><p>Ishu Upanishad - The individual movement in the universal motion.</p><p>A funny tale of a preacher at his first Sunday talk.</p><p>Also the tale of the two boys sent on errands from two monasteries. One boy has clever answers to his questions about everything. The other boy wants a wise retort as well, and prepares an answer for the next day. Little does he know the other boy’s answer changed.

      <description><![CDATA[<p>Zen Roshi, Lola McDowell Lee, suggests you look at your life as a story. Is there anything you would change? <strong>Though this life is not perfect, you’re probably reasonably comfortable living on this shore. Change is scary.</strong></p><p>While many of us are part of a practice group, we really each travel alone on this path. The truth is inside of us. We can’t find it together outside somewhere.</p><p>For your travel on this path you have provisions. In Buddhism, they are called the <em>Paramitas,</em> or perfections.</p><ol><li>Giving. This is not necessarily material giving.

      <description><![CDATA[<p>Zen Roshi, Lola McDowell Lee, explores the possible meanings of several Buddhist and Christian concepts:</p><p>• Pranyaparamita, or “the perfection of transcendental wisdom.”</p><p>• Sunyata, or the emptiness that emptiness constitutes ultimate reality. Not adding, but taking away.</p><p>• <em>Avataṃsaka Sūtra, which </em>comprehensively describes the powers of meditation and emptiness.</p><p>• <em>Anapanasati</em> - awareness of that before you, of your breath.</p><p>• Or when Jesus says to Nicodemus: “Except a man be born of water and of the Spirit, he cannot enter into the kingdom of God.” Your ego must be reduced to ashes. And emptiness remains.</p><p>• Thomas à Kempis, a German-Dutch Augustinian monk, wrote in the Imitation of Christ a strange teaching to “Truly to know and despise self.” But that is not to hate oneself, but one’s obsession with oneself.</p><p>• As the Buddhists teach, eating, bathing mechanically—not mindfully—is doing these activities with disrespect.</p><p>• The Ignorantine Friars of the 1500s taught that the more ignorant you were the better off you were. To not read or write.</p><p>• But Lao Tzu reminds us how precarious it is to chase ideals. “Man on tiptoe is not steady.”</p><p>Ananda noticed the Buddha never changed position during the night, so one day he asked him: "Do you sleep?" His reply: "When the mind is silent, the body sleeps. Awareness does not."</p><p>July 1, 1984 </p>]]></description>

      <description><![CDATA[<p><strong>Zen Roshi, Lola McDowell Lee, discusses the similarities between Hasidic Judaism and Buddhism.</strong></p><p><strong>Many religions are more emotional. Zen practitioners are often intellectual. The similarities between Hasidic Judaism and Buddhism.</strong></p><p><strong>Also, the tale of two men who travel during a dark night. Only one has a lantern. When their paths split, the man without the lantern must grope along in the darkness. That is not unlike being in life without the presence of your teaching. You must learn to be a light unto yourself. Be okay with groping in the darkness. The light will come. Your path is, ultimately, your own—no one else’s. The old man in you must die for the new man to be born. May 19, 1985 </strong></p>]]></description>

      <description><![CDATA[<p>Zen Roshi, Lola McDowell Lee, explores the notion of preferences. As the Third Chinese Patriarch of Zen put it: when love and hate are both absent, everything becomes clear and undisguised. Make the smallest distinction, however, and heaven and earth are set infinitely apart. If you wish to see the truth, then hold no opinions for, or against, anything.</p><p>That is the choice-less reality, true stability. When you make a distinction, you are divided within yourself. The real does not change—only what you project on it.</p><p>Discrimination does not bring happiness. You cannot say, “I will only love. I will not hate.” It’s like saying, “I will only inhale.” Don’t project onto others how you want them to be. No one is here to fulfill your dreams. Only you are.</p><p>The deepest truth lies in the principle of identity. May 12, 1985 </p>]]></description>

      <description><![CDATA[<p>Zen Roshi, Lola McDowell Lee, explains that when most of us listen to a teacher talk, what we hear is determined by our conditioning. When one talks to God in his thoughts, he is not talking to God. To truly practice, one must be wholly sincere and not deceive oneself.</p><p>A monk came to a Zen Master and asked, ”What if you meet up with someone who is deaf, dumb, and blind?” Also, if the aim of a Zen master is to save innumerable beings, how does one explain the behavior of a hermit master?</p><p>A monk asked Kyosei, "I am pecking from inside the shell. I beg you, Master, please peck from outside." But the master asked: “Are you then in a state of readiness?”</p><p>Zen Master Seppo contended that he was not a teacher. Yet 87 of his monks attained. Also, if we are aiming to experience the void, the emptiness, why would anyone want that? May 5, 1985 </p>]]></description>

      <description><![CDATA[<p>During this talk, Zen Roshi, Lola McDowell Lee, has a bad cough, which she lightheartedly uses in her discussion about how to hear and how to listen. To listen like a tape recorder, without thinking. Lola walks us through a quick history of philosophical thinking, from the Ionians (Thales thought the basic entity was water) to Pythagoras to Aristotle and beyond. To discipline oneself in learning is called hearing. Once you’re full of learning, you begin what is called approaching. Then beyond both is transcending. Once one transcends to non-duality, there is nothing to discuss. Lola Apr 14, 1985 </p>]]></description>

      <description><![CDATA[<p>You are born into pleasure and pain, and eventually emotions develop. Then centuries of conditioning. From your parents, from your culture. How many personalities and faces do you have? All creating contradictions in you. But if you dig down, there is unity—an undivided, centered individual. Most important: do not deceive yourself. Sit. Look into yourself and the truth will reveal itself to you. As illusions drop, as attitudes drop, how relaxing it is to be at ease with yourself.

      <itunes:title><![CDATA[The depth in saying “I don’t know.”  Mystica Theologica.  Lola Jul 22, 1985]]></itunes:title>
      <description><![CDATA[<p>Zen Roshi, Lola McDowell Lee, discusses Mystica Theologica by St Dionysias. He said religious experience can’t be described. Like music: as much as you might name notes, no description is adequate to explain what music really is. So it is with religious experience. Dionysias called it “agnosia” or unknowing. There is a depth in saying “I don’t know.” Even Socrates said the only thing he knows is that he knows nothing. The atheist who says he knows there is no God… does not speak from experience. He really does not know. Both the theist and atheist make wrong assumptions.</p><p>We meditate to reduce conditioning, etc. The aim is to set ourselves up to experience an empty silence. The emptiness of unknowing. Of Dionysias’ agnosia. Dionysias called it the “translucent darkness.” Or “Knowing ignorance.” God is light and darkness together. Only then can reality of God be experienced. It can be remembered, but cannot be described. Just: “Ah, this.” That is why the Taoists say the wise man keeps his mouth shut. The world is one—the seen and the unseen—even though we don’t see the world as united. Lola Jul 22, 1985 </p>]]></description>

      <itunes:title><![CDATA[Zen masters never tell the truth. July 15, 1985]]></itunes:title>
      <description><![CDATA[<p>Zen Roshi, Lola McDowell Lee, recounts the tale of Zen Master Hogen who studied with Keishin Zenji. Once Keishin Zenji asked him, 'Joza, where do you go?' “Hogen answered, 'I am making pilgrimage aimlessly." Lola also shares the story of the non-believer who falls off a cliff and dangles by a small twig. He begs God to help him. "But I thought you didn’t believe in me,” says God. The non-believer says, “Okay, I do now. Please save me." So God answers, “Okay, let go of the twig and I will save you.” Zen masters never tell the truth. They may point, or provoke, or create a situation that will help you learn. But if a teacher says what he is saying is the truth, leave him. If you can see the truth, you can see it here—where you are. Nirvana is samsara. July 15, 1985. </p>]]></description>

      <description><![CDATA[<p>Zen Roshi, Lola McDowell Lee, explains how you can ask questions about the meaning of life all day long. But who is the questioner? Usually we take the wrong approach to these questions. The questions and the answers are thoughts—or objects. They are not reality. If you have a deluded mind, how are you supposed to use it in meditation? You must set it aside. When silence is present, where are you? When you aren’t thinking, are you a man or a woman? Tall or short?The real question is “What is the reality of me?” Your mind is full of fragments of your parents, your friends, teachers, books you’ve read. But where is the mind itself? The same one that has always been <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href="http://there.You">there.You</a> can’t have someone meditate for you and tell you about it. Enlightenment is a personal experience. The mind dwells in the cave of the heart. He who conquers it frees himself from slavery. May 26, 1985 </p>]]></description>

      <description><![CDATA[<p>Zen Roshi, Lola McDowell Lee, shares the teachings of Lao Tzu. He was not a brave man. Or a coward. Courage does not play a role in the sage. The mightiest fighting rooster does not crow about his might. True confidence does not brag. If you meet a sage on the road, how do you greet him? Meditation is like a coiled spring. You push, push, push it down… then release. Jun 24, 1984 </p>]]></description>

      <itunes:title><![CDATA[When you’re silent, there is one mind. When you’re thinking, you are many. Jun 10, 1984]]></itunes:title>
      <description><![CDATA[<p>Zen Roshi, Lola McDowell Lee, explains how a mirror reflects everything before it. It reflects young you when you’re young. It reflects old you when you’re old. But the mirror isn’t old or young. It is uncontaminated. The same consciousness is watching from inside you when you’re young, when you’re middle aged and when you’re old. But that Witness isn’t young or middle aged or old. Just like the mirror, your consciousness doesn’t change. Just the content is different. We all have heard teachings about being good. Buddha said “if you cleanse your heart, your conduct will be unimpeachable. Feeling good about yourself should be a natural thing. A child instinctively wants freedom. The child thinks freedom is good. But then Mother restricts freedom, which says it’s wrong. The child then thinks “I must be wrong.” To be truly good means to be conscious in everything you do. Gurdjieff’s stop method worked to help his students be conscious in everything they did. When you’re silent, there is one mind. When you’re thinking, you are many. And in tumult. Thinking disturbs the silent mind. And he rejects himself. As a human you have a rare opportunity to wake up. Don’t squander that opportunity. Jun 10, 1984 </p>]]></description>

      <description><![CDATA[<p>Zen Roshi, Lola McDowell Lee, explains how when you’re happy, sad, pleased, unpleased—it’s all in your periphery. It is not really you. When you’re happy, sad, pleased, displeased—it’s all in your periphery. It is not really you. Do not deceive yourself with your own attitudes. Plastic flowers do not grow. Plastic personas do not grow. But you can. Your appearances give you respectability but they do not give you contentment. Examine your past so it doesn’t govern you. The past is dead. Stop living it. Whenever you taste the ocean, it always tastes like salt. Find your own unity. Your eyes discriminate. You can open them, close them, direct them. But it’s different with our ears—everything comes in. Truth eventually will reveal itself. Oct 30, 1983 </p>]]></description>

      <itunes:title><![CDATA[Once we understand we are not the masters of our thoughts—but victims—we can stop cooperating. Lola Mar 17, 1985]]></itunes:title>
      <description><![CDATA[<p>Zen Roshi, Lola McDowell Lee, recounts tales of Master Fugai. Lola gives a detailed explanation of meditation. How the word meditation, historically, has been thought to mean thinking, pondering. But in Zen it’s just the opposite. In Zen meditation you sit, and can watch your thoughts go by, but you do not get swept up by them. If you observe closely you’ll start to see that your thoughts create a circular pattern… over and over, and at the center of this circle is a point with which you are identified: anger, or greed or some other kind of self-centeredness. Once we understand we are not the masters of our thoughts—but victims—we can stop cooperating, stop remaining a victim of them. When you sit, don’t cling to thoughts or emotions. Just sit. And be. Zen is not something you just read in a book. It is an encounter with reality. Also, Lola discusses how religions can broadly be divided into two different approaches: the path of the heart and the path of the mind. You can pursue God through your heart—with love. Not romantic love, or sexual love. But God’s love, or agape. Lola Mar 17, 1985 </p>]]></description>

      <description><![CDATA[<p>Zen Roshi, Lola McDowell Lee, discusses how we’re all waiting for the most extraordinary teacher. We want only the best. The tale of the visitor who asked Zen master Bankei what miracles he could perform. His answer is lovely Zen. Lola lso, understanding the concept of “don’t know.” It’s very difficult. We all prefer to be clever, which obscures our original mind. If you recognize the original mind, will you reincarnate? Bunka says it won’t matter to you. That is the interest of the ego. Listen to the teacher with no inner commentary. The unconditioned is pure consciousness. Even in our dreams we have a censor that doesn’t allow some material to come up from our unconscious. (Lola has a bad cough through this talk). Aug 6, 1989 </p>]]></description>

The second in a series about the Transactional Analysis approach of Child, Parent, Adult. Child enjoys the moment through feeling, often irrationally. The Parental Voice then comes in to caution the child. The Adult brings reason. But Adult reason alone is not the answer. Lola Oct 13, 1983 </p>]]></description>

      <description><![CDATA[<p>Zen Roshi, Lola McDowell Lee, explains three parts of our psychology working against each other --the parent, the child and the adult. The child’s impulses and emotions shouldn’t be in control. The parent alone can be dominating.The adult hold to reason only, which can make for a flat life. Some part will be dissatisfied. Ideally, we become a part of all three. The Buddha doesn’t choose one. He takes the middle path, a the center of all three.</p><p>Three stages of our development: 1. We do something and are aware we did it. 2. We ask ourself “What am I doing?”</p><p>3. We are going to do something, but our awareness stops us. Pratyahara means being present. Awareness, mindfulness, stops you. It is difficult to repent without putting your ego back into it. True correction is reform. Insults are meaningless unless you accept them. How to sit with this? Be mindful and you can have the spontaneity of the child and the reason of the adult and parent. Then the three become one—the single I. Oct 6, 1983 </p>]]></description>

Instead, he cooperates, harmonizes with the situation. The tale of Frederick The Great of Prussia’s solution to the many sparrows eating his kingdom's grain. Cleansing your mind is not a one-time effort. Because each day you gather more dust. So Lola suggests you meditate twice a day. Once to give yourself a clean start to the day. Second, at the end of the day, to cleanse the dust you’ve accumulated.

      <description><![CDATA[<p>Zen Roshi, Lola McDowell Lee, discusses Love, Life and Death. When you are filled with love, there is nothing missing. Can you love without a lover? Some people share their loneliness and call it love. The most important thing for you is your life. Yet most of us never thoroughly investigate it. In deep meditation you can. Death is an unpopular subject All you think you are now is going to die. Face yourself—beyond time and space. When you are alone, do you lie to yourself? When you let go, where do you let go to? We too are lucky to be born in the time of a Buddha. And that Buddha can be us. Nov 20, 1983 </p>]]></description>

      <description><![CDATA[<p>Understanding the noetic quality of mind, the hidden self, through meditation. That is just a matter of sitting, and being who you are. The difference between sailing on a paper boat and a real boat: How we think about what enlightenment will be. And being it firsthand. Many of us parrot what we know from things we’ve heard or read. We can repeat the most profound teachings and remain stupid. What in us is orginal? A tale of Zen Master Dokuon. May 1, 1983 </p>]]></description>

      <description><![CDATA[<p>Zen Roshi, Lola McDowell Lee, asks: When you are alone… are you really alone? We treat the ego as an absolute, when, in fact, it is a gap between you and totality. Ask yourself: Who am I? And you’ll find the Buddha. ﻿What does a Zen teacher do? Beyond aloneness and togetherness is the eternal — no one going nowhere. Non-dualistic wisdom. Remain in the Witness your whole life. It’ll change things. Jul 3, 1983 </p>]]></description>

      <itunes:title><![CDATA[The Taoist sage, Lieh Tzu, was once asked: Why do you value emptiness? Jun 12, 1983]]></itunes:title>
      <description><![CDATA[<p>Zen Roshi, Lola McDowell Lee, explains how existence is reported to us as separate objects. But there is a unity to life that runs through everything—called the Tao. The Taoist sage, Lieh Tzu, was once asked: Why do you value emptiness? His answer is explained. Also, most spiritual paths fall into two categories: <em>via affirmative</em> and <em>via negativa. </em>The affirmative path is where we take actions to make progress. The danger is the ego. The negative path is the path of Zen, an interior path of negation. The danger is lethargy. Though Zen practitioners have activities and devices they use, so we might say they use a little of both paths. Jun 12, 1983 </p>]]></description>

      <description><![CDATA[<p>Zen Roshi, Lola McDowell Lee, explores how it is In the other that we see what we think is us. When we are alone, many of us feel in strange company. It’s possible to see what one’s life is really about. The thoughts out there, which have have become a mask to our true selves, will grow dimmer. Until our spiritual search is no longer just a curiosity or inquiry—but becomes a deep hunger that consumes us. Someone once asked a Zen master, "What is the greatest miracle in the world?” His answer: “I am sitting here alone.” Oct 30, 1983 </p>]]></description>

      <description><![CDATA[<p>Zen Roshi, Lola McDowell Lee, recounts the tale of a teacher’s interaction with his student, Hakuin, who became the founder of Rinzai. From Hakuin’s “Song Of Meditation” we hear: “All beings are from the very beginning Buddhas. It is like water and ice: apart from water, no ice. Outside living beings, no Buddhas. Not knowing it is near, they seek it afar. What a pity!” Jun 5, 1983 </p>]]></description>

But have you ever seen a Zen master sitting still? They are always doing something. There is silence and there is action. The mind and the body. We have both. And we need both to understand. We need to learn how to bring ourselves to our action. Thinking about our actions afterward does little good. Learning to act spontaneously. ﻿ May 29, 1983 </p>]]></description>

      <description><![CDATA[<p>Zen Roshi, Lola McDowell Lee, explains that we are in an in-between state. We’re not unconscious and we’re not completely conscious. We are objectively self-conscious—conscious of things out there, and we think of ourselves as things, too.&nbsp;We are stuck in this world between the unconscious and conscious.&nbsp;As fas as thinking goes, we’re fine. The mind can do that. We can also talk. But when it comes to acting—doing something—we need the energy of the unconscious. That’s where all the energy is. Our thinking minds cannot actually do anything.&nbsp;The objectively self-aware ego is helpless. May 15, 1983</p>]]></description>

      <description><![CDATA[<p>Zen Roshi, Lola McDowell Lee, explains how existence renders actual . Non-existence renders useful. It is not the walls, but the seemingly non-actual space within the house, that renders it useful. Chuang Tzu teaches us to appreciate the useless in the world. Kierkegaard used to go to church and tell God things he wanted. But then he realized that God knows everything, so why is he telling God what to do? Eventually he learned to be silent, and just listen to God. The absence of talking was more useful than talking. Mar 6, 1983</p>]]></description>

      <description><![CDATA[<p>Zen Roshi, Lola McDowell Lee, explains that when we are born we emerge from a mysterious life source, and when we die we return to that source. And now, in mediation, we have the opportunity to know that source. &nbsp;When you are asleep and breathing, there is still consciousness. When you are self-conscious, you are in a sense unconscious, and when you are not self-conscious, you are conscious.&nbsp;The intellect cannot penetrate consciousness. When you drop thoughts, &nbsp;consciousness is present. When you drop the pseudo self, the True Self is present.&nbsp;We blame our misery on everything from past lives to Satan, etc. but our self-consciousness is responsible for our misery.&nbsp;July 12, 198</p>]]></description>

      <itunes:title><![CDATA[What is the meaning of movement and rest, in Zen and Christian practice? Dec 13, 1981]]></itunes:title>
      <description><![CDATA[<p>Zen Roshi (and ordained Christian minister), Lola McDowell Lee, discusses the Christian notion of sin. In Aramaic sin means to miss, and does not have guilt or shame associated with it like we do. St. Thomas: “If they ask you, ‘What is the sign of your father in you?’, say to them ‘It is movement and repose.'” What is movement and repose, or rest, in Zen and Christian practice? Rest is a silent, choiceness awareness, without time, without movement. Dec 13, 1981</p>]]></description>
