    <itunes:new-feed-url>https://feeds.transistor.fm/super-heroes-in-heels-with-kimberley-borgens</itunes:new-feed-url>
    <description>The podcast focuses on fiercely empowering women in business, as entrepreneurs and women in male-dominated industries, featuring guests who embody strength, resilience, competence, and a touch of sass as they navigate business and life.
Looking for guests who are willing to bring a wealth of experience and knowledge but also possess the strength, resilience, and sass that align with the tone of my podcast. 
I want their stories and insights to provide immense value to my audience, helping me to establish a powerful podcast as a must-listen for women looking to empower themselves in business. The goal is to build competence and discover how brave women can be in business. </description>

        <![CDATA[<p>Are you ready to redefine what leadership looks like in the modern workplace? In this episode of Superheroes in Heels, host Kimberley Borgens invites women everywhere to step into their authentic power and command presence, not by imitating old paradigms, but by embracing the unique strengths that come with feminine leadership.</p><p>Kimberley unpacks the history of leadership models and challenges the notion that success comes only through traditional, top-down approaches. Instead, she champions a new era—one where empathy, collaboration, and intuition are recognized as pillars of sustainable success. Through personal reflections, tactical negotiation strategies, and real-world examples from trailblazing women like Indra Nooyi, Mary Barra, and Whitney Wolfe Herd, listeners will learn how to advocate for themselves, build bridges instead of walls, and celebrate the superpowers that make them exceptional leaders.</p><p>This episode offers practical exercises to help you recognize and lean into your authentic leadership qualities, command any room with confidence, and turn everyday wins into a foundation for lasting impact. Kimberley’s weekly Superhero Challenge invites you to lead with presence, whether at work, networking, or at home—proving that leadership isn’t about playing by someone else’s rules, but rewriting them as your own.</p><p>Whether you’re tuning in for inspiration, actionable tips, or the stories of women who dared to lead differently, this episode will empower you to own your narrative, elevate your presence, and become the leader the world needs—heels, sneakers, or otherwise.</p>

        <![CDATA[<p>Are you ready to redefine what leadership looks like in the modern workplace? In this episode of Superheroes in Heels, host Kimberley Borgens invites women everywhere to step into their authentic power and command presence, not by imitating old paradigms, but by embracing the unique strengths that come with feminine leadership.</p><p>Kimberley unpacks the history of leadership models and challenges the notion that success comes only through traditional, top-down approaches. Instead, she champions a new era—one where empathy, collaboration, and intuition are recognized as pillars of sustainable success. Through personal reflections, tactical negotiation strategies, and real-world examples from trailblazing women like Indra Nooyi, Mary Barra, and Whitney Wolfe Herd, listeners will learn how to advocate for themselves, build bridges instead of walls, and celebrate the superpowers that make them exceptional leaders.</p><p>This episode offers practical exercises to help you recognize and lean into your authentic leadership qualities, command any room with confidence, and turn everyday wins into a foundation for lasting impact. Kimberley’s weekly Superhero Challenge invites you to lead with presence, whether at work, networking, or at home—proving that leadership isn’t about playing by someone else’s rules, but rewriting them as your own.</p><p>Whether you’re tuning in for inspiration, actionable tips, or the stories of women who dared to lead differently, this episode will empower you to own your narrative, elevate your presence, and become the leader the world needs—heels, sneakers, or otherwise.</p>

        <![CDATA[<p>In this compelling episode, we dive into the transformative power of coaching for entrepreneurs and business owners facing overwhelming financial obstacles. Listen as we share the real-life journeys of two clients whose lives were dramatically changed through guidance, accountability, and unwavering support.</p><p>First, we recount the story of a client burdened by deep shame and guilt, who hesitated to ask for help when her business finances spiraled out of control. Behind on her bookkeeping and unable to pay state and federal taxes, she felt trapped, until coaching provided her with clarity and a trusted process to catch up on her books and settle her tax obligations. With strategic connections, including an offer-in-compromise attorney, she found the confidence and resources to work with the IRS and resolve the business’s back taxes.</p><p>Next, we highlight a second client’s remarkable journey: determined to break free from the weight of $60,000 in credit card debt, she embraced challenging but necessary steps. The ripple effect of her hard-won financial independence became clear when she faced an unexpected $25,000 debt run-up and the shock of a divorce. Empowered by her coaching experience, she found the strength to protect her family, provide for her two sons, and step into her new life as a resilient single mother and capable business owner.</p><p>Through these stories, we explore the essential role of confidence, courage, and stretching beyond comfort zones, revealing how personalized coaching can spark lasting change in both personal and professional spheres.</p>

        <![CDATA[<p>Have you ever been questioned about your credibility as the leader of your company? For thirty-three years, I’ve devoted my life to building and leading my private security business, not from the sidelines, but from the heart of the action. On this episode, I confront the question that’s been asked of me in boardrooms, conversations and on application forms: “Are you a CEO in designation only?” The answer is simple - absolutely not!</p><p>I am an architect and the engine behind every facet of my company. I process payroll, oversee my management team, write policies, create systems, manage finances, and personally train the leaders who help our business thrive. My work is not symbolic; it’s substantive. I did not inherit a title nor step into a ready-made role. I built this business from the ground up with my partner walking alongside me and have steered its course, day after day, year after year.</p><p>As a woman CEO and owner, I’ve faced skepticism about my involvement, especially when seeking the minority-owned business designation. But let me be clear: my leadership is woven into the very fabric of this company’s success. I may not be the constant face of the business, (that’s what I have a partner for) but I am the heart that leads this business forward. This episode is a testament to the grit, sweat, and unwavering commitment it takes to lead—not as a figurehead, but as a hands-on, strategic force. If you’ve ever wondered about what it truly means to be a CEO, listen in for a candid, passionate perspective on embodying the role and shattering stereotypes in business ownership.</p>

        <![CDATA[<p>In this honest and gritty episode, Maybe You Are An Imposter - Or Maybe You Are Playing Small, we dive into the real and relatable experience of imposter syndrome, especially as it shows up for women leaders striving to own their authority. Join us as we unpack the stories we tell ourselves, the doubts, the moments of feeling out of place, and the internal voices that whisper, “Who let me in here?” Real conversation to redefine what it means to sit at the table, challenge the myths of confidence always preceding action, and confront the cultural narratives that have trained us to undervalue our natural strengths.</p><p>With wisdom from decades in business, Kimberley will share actionable insights for transforming imposter thoughts into fuel for growth. Listeners will discover how authentic executive presence is built not just on what we do, but on how we choose to show up every single day. Whether you’re new to leadership or a seasoned executive, this episode empowers you to move past playing small and step boldly into your power, for yourself and those who follow.</p>

        <![CDATA[<p>Are you ready to revolutionize your marketing game? In this episode, we sit down with Amy Matthews, a visionary CEO and Chief Marketing Officer for multi-million-dollar clients. Amy delves into the biggest mistakes businesses and individuals make in their marketing strategies—and how ego, both yours and your clients’, can impact your success. Drawing from her wealth of experience, she offers actionable insights and powerful tips to elevate your approach to customer engagement. Whether you’re an entrepreneur, marketer, or business owner, this episode promises to spark fresh ideas and improve your marketing results. Tune in and discover how to market smarter, not harder!</p><p><strong>Amy Matthews' Bio:</strong><br>Amy Matthews is a fractional CMO and strategic marketing expert who helps multi-million dollar businesses break through growth plateaus and achieve sustainable scaling.

        <![CDATA[<p>Have you let fear hold you back from creating the support of a community? In this episode, we dive into the profound impact building a community can have on reducing fear and empowering action, whether you're working to grow a business or share a beloved hobby.

Since then, Misty’s knack for turning ideas into income has only grown. After years of running a successful marketing agency, she realized she was just building another job, not the life of freedom she envisioned. That’s when she pivoted, harnessing her passion for community-building and her marketing expertise to help aspiring entrepreneurs 40+ turn their skills, experience, and passions into thriving online communities.</p><p>Misty is known for her practical, no-fluff approach and her signature framework, The Community Cashflow Code™, which guides entrepreneurs through a step-by-step formula to grow and monetize their communities.

        <![CDATA[<p>Have you let fear hold you back from creating the support of a community? In this episode, we dive into the profound impact building a community can have on reducing fear and empowering action, whether you're working to grow a business or share a beloved hobby. At the heart of every success story lies a network of individuals who encourage, support, and uplift one another. Today, we explore how cultivating such a community can help you overcome challenges and pave the way to achieving your dreams.</p><p><strong>Misty Kortes' Bio:</strong><br>Misty Kortes is an entrepreneur, author, speaker, community strategist, and the founder of The Community Launchpad and The Extraordinary Entrepreneur Community. With over three decades of business-building experience under her belt, Misty has helped thousands of entrepreneurs break free from the 9-to-5 grind and create profitable, freedom-based businesses they love.</p><p>Her journey into entrepreneurship started early, think first grade, selling homemade tattoos at recess. Since then, Misty’s knack for turning ideas into income has only grown. After years of running a successful marketing agency, she realized she was just building another job, not the life of freedom she envisioned. That’s when she pivoted, harnessing her passion for community-building and her marketing expertise to help aspiring entrepreneurs 40+ turn their skills, experience, and passions into thriving online communities.</p><p>Misty is known for her practical, no-fluff approach and her signature framework, The Community Cashflow Code™, which guides entrepreneurs through a step-by-step formula to grow and monetize their communities. Her programs infuse gamification, affirmations, and clarity-driven training to make launching a business feel fun, empowering, and doable, especially for those reinventing themselves later in life.</p><p>When she’s not supporting her community members or speaking on stages, you’ll find Misty exploring new places, recording episodes of The Misty Kortes Show, or hanging out with her husband of 30+ years and their four amazing kids.</p><p>Her mission is clear: to help more people live life on their own terms, with freedom, flexibility, and control.</p><p><strong>Connect with Misty:</strong><br><strong>Ready to Turn Your Passion Into a Profitable Community?<br></strong><br></p><p>Join <em>The Community Launchpad</em>—the free space for aspiring community creators who are DONE with the 9-to-5 and ready to build a freedom-based business.
